39293,Contrave,Weight Loss,"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two.

Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot.

MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.

Overall pretty happy with results only negative aspect is the amount of time it takes for it to work.""",9,29-Feb-12,110
72195,Tramadol,Chronic Pain,"""I take it for gastrointestinal pain and it works fairly well. My pain often gets to the point of me wanting to punch everything in sight, and tramadol helps to quiet it. The only downsides are that it takes a little longer to start working than I need it to, since this unbearable pain can arise in a few minutes. Additionally, it causes constipation even in low doses, which can contribute to further gastrointestinal pain.""",9,31-May-14,20

After a few days i experienced very mild itching and some slight redness, but this may have been my imagination. The warts seemed to get bigger at the start but quickly vanished and now i have no visible warts at all! I used Warticon before and it did absolutely nothing, so i was thrilled to see something finally working. Give it time and patience. One word of advice,  i used this cream and got cryotherapy done around the same time. I would wait a week or so after cryo, apply the cream for a few weeks, then repeat of necessary. This seemed to really help.""",8,2-Nov-15,12

She was very good during the insertion about letting me know when pain would occur. It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since. I have had no issues with my boyfriend and the strings or being dry &quot;down there&quot; as I have read with some others. My sex drive has increased since having it.""",10,5-Mar-17,7

Over a forty day period my Lisinopril dosage was increased in stages from 5mg to 40mg in an attempt to get the same BP results I had with Amlodipine.  Prior to taking Lisinopril my blood pressure was around 135/75.  As the amount of Lisinopril was increased my blood pressure kept increasing. After 40 days it was around 175/85 (maximum 200/100).  I take my blood pressure 3 -4 times per day.   I experienced increased confusion, tiredness, dizziness, weakness and constipation as the dosage of Lisinopril was increased.

When I finally got back on the pills, I thought it was great because my periods were always regular, I had no weight gain, and my skin was flawless.  But, after being on it for 6 months now I&#039;m realizing that this pill is the reason for my poor mental health.  I went from being happy and satisfied with my life, to being an actual crazy person.  I started lashing out at the people I loved as the months progressed. I would have the worst mood swings of my life.  I would be happy and laughing, and the next minute I was in tears.  It turned me into an angry person that I didn&#039;t know.""",3,26-Sep-16,0
24509,Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes,Bowel Preparation,"""My colonoscopy was booked in for late afternoon on a Thursday. The hospital said to stop eating anything from 1pm on the Wednesday and recommended (giving some detail) a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon - avoiding dark drinks and jelly (like blackcurrant flavour). Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. 

The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. 

On Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before. I can only assume there was nothing left to eject.

They were so bad that I took time off from work because I could not stand up. I bled almost constantly the entire time, and it was very heavy spotting, heavier than I had ever had from a period before using the ring. I bled heavily during and after intercourse. 

After the cramps became unbearable and I could not stand bleeding as heavily as I was I decided to come off nuva ring. It took my body seven months to stop bleeding heavily. I had heavy periods for two weeks at a time as my body readjusted. And even now my periods last longer than they did before using the ring. I also have spotting in between periods, and I never had spotting before using the ring.

I have dropped to this dose over the last year. (I also left the old patch on). I have been on opiates for 12 years full time prescribed. At my highest prescription I was using 180mg of Oxycodone and 180 mg of morphine per day. I have had several adjustments on medicine including extended release doses. 5 years ago I was put on 50 mug of Fanta to with 3-10 mg Oxys per day for breakthrough. I started leaving my old patches on to increase my daily dose. This last year I tapered Down to 25 mcg patches for 48 hours.( still leaving my old patches on.) I went to a doctor that prescribes Suboxone. Lucky for me my insurance pays for Suboxone. He gave me the 8/2 mg strips. I take 1/2 a strip twice a day. I was checking every forum to see how long I needed to wait to start the suboxone. The replies are all very different. Some say 16 hours, most day 24. Others say 48-36-72 hours. Yikes! How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm. (I already have my suboxone script at home. ) so I started feeling withdrawal symptoms coming on around 11 pm. They didn&#039;t get super intense. I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom, anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling. Not high, but even my regular dose meds haven&#039;t made me high for years... so if your guessing on when it&#039;s ok to take suboxone after opiates, and fentanyl seems to be the highest strength, then I day shoot for 24 hours. If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it&#039;s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour. I have not gotten the precipices withdrawals so far. Hope this helps someone. Good luck to you!""",9,27-May-17,24

Small amounts now give a full feeling.  I enjoy slow eating now and all the tastes.  I got dry mouth at first but now don&#039;t as I drink water like everyone says you should.  Only now I enjoy it.

Mind you before having him my periods were &quot;normal.&quot; After having him, my period was EXTREMELY heavy lasting 5 to 7 days. I was going through 3 and 4 super pads WITH super tampons.

The only side effect I sometimes get is dry mouth, so make sure to drink plenty of water if that happens to you. Biotene mouthwash also helps with that.

I also suffer from PCOS and saw dramatic improvement with my periods. They became lighter and always on their time, whereas before the pill I used to bleed 2-3 times per month. However, this pill is not a panacea and it is definitely not harmless. My libido has reduced, I  too experience the occasional paranoia and extreme irritability, my cholesterol and triglycerides have risen although I follow a balanced diet and exercise but I did not gain any weight.
