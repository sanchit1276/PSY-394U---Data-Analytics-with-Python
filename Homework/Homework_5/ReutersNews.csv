gnp,"SPAIN REVISES ECONOMIC TARGETS FOR 1987  Spain has revised some of its main  economic targets for 1987 after studying the performance of the  economy in the first quarter, the economy ministry said in its  monthly bulletin.      Internal demand is now forecast to rise four pct against a  previous target of 3.5 pct.      Mariano Rubio, governor of the Bank of Spain, the central  bank, yesterday said internal demand was currently growing at  an annual rate of six pct and it had to be brought down to four  pct if the government were to meet its five pct inflation  target this year. Inflation was 8.3 pct in 1986.      The forecast for private consumption growth remains  unchanged at three pct, although public consumption is revised  upwards to 2.5 pct from 2.0 pct.      Growth in domestic demand will fuel imports, expected to  increase by 8.6 pct against an originally estimated 7.1 pct.      Export growth has been revised downwards to 3.7 pct from  5.2 pct due to the peseta's continuing strength against the  dollar and slack external demand.      Slow growth of exports and a tight rein on state spending  has lowered estimated GDP growth to three pct in 1987 from an  earlier forecast 3.5 pct. GDP grew by three pct last year.      The economy ministry is holding its inflation forecast to  five pct, in spite of minister Carlos Solchaga's doubts last  week on whether this target could be maintained if wage  settlements continue to rise above the government's recommended  five pct ceiling.      Unions and employers dispute the average wage increases  agreed so far this year. Trade unions calculate wage  settlements have produced average rises of 7.3 pct against 5.5  pct estimated by the employers' federation CEOE.  "
livestock,"JAPAN'S LIPC TO BUY BEEF ON APRIL 23  Japan's Livestock Industry Promotion Corp  (LIPC) said that on April 28 it will import 7,515 tonnes of  beef for the first half of the 1987 fiscal year started on  April 1 under the simultaneous buy and sell tender system,  against 6,813 a year ago.      The system calls on the agency to buy beef from trading  houses and simultaneously sell it to users in one tender. The  tender quota in April-September is 10 pct of the agency's beef  import share. Japan's beef import quota in 1987/88 was set at  93,000 tonnes against 85,000 for the same period in 1986/87.  "
gold,"SIGMA MINES DETAILS GOLD ORE RESERVES  &lt;Sigma Mines (Quebec) Ltd>, 65 pct  owned by Dome Mines Ltd, said its Sigma Mine had proven and  probable reserves at the end of 1986 of 4,902,940 tons, with an  average grade of 0.139 ounces of gold a ton.      Sigma said the reserves are equivalent to 10 years future  production at current milling rates.      The reserves comprise 1,640,779 tons proven reserves  grading an average of 0.163 ounces of gold a ton and 3,262,161  tons probable reserves grading an average of 0.127 ounces of  gold a ton.      Sigma said it changed its 1986 reserve reporting method  following Dome Mines' previously reported move to adopt general  industry practice of reporting proven and probable ore  reserves.      Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven  reserves that could be mined without future development costs.      Proven reserves as of December 31, 1985 were 978,000 tons  grading an average of 0.194 ounces of gold a ton, equivalent to  about two years future production.  "
gnp,"SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH  Strong growth in domestic demand was a key  feature of the economies of southern European countries in  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.      In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth  restrained private consumption.      Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected  to be halved to five pct next year.      In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross  Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption  were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain  strong.      The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply  next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European  Community and declining competitiveness.      In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards  following an increase early this year linked with the  introduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices due  to cold weather.  "

gnp,"TURKEY ESTIMATES 1986 GROWTH AT EIGHT PCT  Turkey's Gross National Product grew an  estimated 8.0 pct in 1986 at fixed 1968 prices, compared with  5.1 pct in 1985, the State Statistics Institute said.      Reporting full-year data, it also said Gross Domestic  Product rose 8.3 pct compared with 5.1 pct in 1985. An earlier  estimate from nine-month data put full-year GNP and GDP growth  both at 7.9 pct.      The government's GNP growth target for 1987 is five pct,  the same level it had set for 1986.      The institute estimated per capita GNP for 1986 at 1,116.6  dlrs, up from 1,045.3 dlrs in 1985.      Officials blame the high 1986 GNP growth on a surge in  domestic demand stemming partly from poorly controlled  municipal expenditures in the early part of the year.      Industry grew at 11.1 pct in real terms in 1986 compared  with 6.6 pct in 1985 while agriculture expanded 7.4 pct  compared with 2.8 pct.  "
gold,"HOMESTAKE MULLS BUYING ORE RESERVES  Homestake Mining Co is considering  acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's  exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters  in an interview.      Conger said, ""the move to consider acquisitions represents  a change in the company's acquistions policy.""      Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120  mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,  Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which  have not been drawn on and could be used to finance an  acquisition, he said.      Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be  about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs.      Conger said exploration for precious metals may be slightly  higher than last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and  gas exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's  9.6 pct.      Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about  the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.      However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400  ounces due to start-up production problems.      He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400  U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.  "
gold,"SPHINX MINING &lt;SPNXF.O> FINDS GOLD  Sphinx Mining Inc said leased  mining claims in Alaska could produce revenues between 322 mln  dlrs and 966 mln dlrs from gold reserves.      The range of the value of the reserves is attributed to the  wide range of grade estimates of the ore, the company said.      A 1984 feasibility study put the grade at 0.008 ounces per  cubic yard, while subsequent exploration work proved that areas  of higher-grade gravel of up to 0.027 ounces/yard do exist,  Sphinx said.      The claims are located 80 miles northwest of Fairbanks.  "
gnp,"ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN SLUGGISH IN BENELUX COUNTRIES  Economic growth will remain sluggish in  the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may  rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  forecast.      Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and  next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD  said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could  stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus  will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.      While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming  its borrowing requirement, ""it will probably be insufficient to  check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,"" the OECD said.      In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5  pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming  less competitive and imports rising. ""Employment is forecast to  decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the  private sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said.      Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987  and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining  domestic gas prices.      Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster  growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in  wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.  "
livestock,"FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER  French Agricultural Minister  Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject  proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar  and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these  markets.      The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention  period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the  financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in  lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.      ""I give you my word that France, while it will not reject  technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply  in the negative to these bad reforms,"" Guillaume told the annual  conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA   (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).      Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again  Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling  EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.      Relations between the government and farmers have become  strained in France in recent months.      There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by  farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and  further cutbacks in Community milk output.      But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation  of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major  producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the  FNSEA's farmers.      His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the  complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes  designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary  Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid  further protests by producers.      Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go  ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad  against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm  sector.      ""The Minister's proposals back up our determination to  organise union action in the coming weeks,"" he told reporters,  adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a  ministerial level.      Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being  appointed farm minister last spring.      Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that  Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.      There have been certain advances on cutting production  costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but  there are still areas where more could be done such as on  farmers' indebtedness, he said.      Guillaume told the conference the government will make  available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers  reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.      The government has already announced financial aid for the  milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package  announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.  "
gnp,"S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET  South Africa is expected to unveil  tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year  in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,  economic analysts said.      Faced with competing demands for increased military and  police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black  housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is  expected to raise significantly the government's overall  expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,  the analysts said.      Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state  spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the  financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas  from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.      ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but  simply raising government spending and increasing the budget  deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,  chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.      South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted  growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of  less than one pct.      Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5  pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to  over 30 pct.      Economists estimate that the government's spending target  will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at  around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of  GDP.      The government, having consistently overshot its own  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the  budget, analysts said.      ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the  money and capital markets.      South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the  IMF.      ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predicted  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past  two years.      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over  loans to the country in September 1985.      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,  government officials say economic growth is the prime  objective.      But private-sector economists caution that the government's  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the  current account of the country's balance of payments.      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international  creditor banks.      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has  little room to manoeuvre.      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only  election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.      ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented Harry  Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive  Federal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the  sweets were given out before the election.""  "

gold,"PRECIOUS METALS CLIMATE IMPROVING, SAYS MONTAGU  The climate for precious metals is  improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears  and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets,  brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.      Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due  to a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative  to gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. In  March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.      The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,  and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is  modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.      The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to  continue in the short term.      A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices  attempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as  the dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver  was positive.      However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the  other metals by such a margin, Montagu said.  "

Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase  output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70  billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies, Li added.      ""We expect this mine to be worth about 2,000 billion yen in  gold deposits,"" he said.      The mine, started in 1896 by a U.S. Company, is one of six  or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area, 94 miles  north of Pyongyang, Li said.      Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would  increase yields. ""Up to now, the mining was done with antiquated  methods and basic equipment.""      The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by  North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors.

nat-gas,"TEXACO &lt;TX> RESERVES DOWN DESPITE LOWER OUTPUT  Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves  declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward  revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its  annual report said.      The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as  was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of  the judgement won by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> against Texaco on  charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire  Getty Oil Co.      The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the  company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in  this case could cause it ""to face prospects such as having to  seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the  bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of the  federal bankruptcy code.      Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced  Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,  Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the  appeals court no later than March 30.      Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company  and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels  at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.      However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern  Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the  decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of  1985.      Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries  declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and  upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln  barrels from 117 mln, respectively.      Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United  States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from  1.55 billion.      The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000  barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with  about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --  representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in  response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.      Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion  cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at  the end of 1985.  "

It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue  underground development and obtain operating permits and  another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete  underground development, construct a mill and provide the  infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial  production.      St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were  granted in time, it would start gold production in the second  half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of  about 40,000 troy ounces.      The company said the property is estimated to contain over  500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project  covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves  of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.      It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150  tons of ore daily.      St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been  tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and  exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and  the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property.

livestock,"RENEWED BULL SPREADING LIKELY ON CATTLE REPORT  Livestock analysts expect renewed bull  spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA  7-state cattle on feed report.      The USDA reported high placements in February, which may  weigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued  strong marketings during the month will support the April  contract.      Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50  cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts  said.      Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle  on feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom  O'Hare. ""They have no place to send the grain,"" he said.      Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while  the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may  offset much of the effect of the report, analysts said.      ""The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,""  said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that  even though placements came in above the average trade guess,  many traders had expected high placements.      Placements are not that negative, especially since the  technical correction in June and August live cattle futures  since last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said.      He said the current marketing posture will provide added  support to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been  running at a heavier than expected pace.      Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with  the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of  the year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But  the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year  ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted.      ""So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings. They  (feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had  intended for the first quarter, which is a bullish  development,"" Levitt said.      Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of  March are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling  behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace.  "

gnp,"ITALIAN 1987 GDP GROWTH FORECAST AT THREE PCT  Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) will  grow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988,  said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc  (DRI).      Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at a  conference that Italian GDP growth this year ""will be mainly  driven by consumption and especially investment.""      Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year  will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of  expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies.      Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7  pct in real terms in 1986.      DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct  in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest  rates should drop two pct.      Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct  against the dollar this year following last year's 22 pct  appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the  dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its  value relative to the German currency, he said.      DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products  should grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year's 6.2  pct increase.  "

Santos said the bid values TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs. It said  it already holds 1.91 mln of TMOC's 25 cent par shares.      TMOC held interests outside the Cooper Basin region of  South Australia and Queensland and the acquisition would  further the Santos objective of developing as a broadly based  oil and gas company with interests outside its existing base in  the Cooper Basin, the company said in a statement.      Santos said TMOC holds several important domestic oil and  gas production, exploration and pipeline interests.      In the Northern Territory it has a 43.75 pct stake in and  operates the Mereenie oil and gas field in the Amadeus Basin  and owns 32 pct of &lt;N.T. Gas Pty Ltd>, owner and operator of  the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline.      In Queensland, TMOC has extensive interests in the Surat  Basin, including the 100 pct owned and operated Moonie oil  field and 33 pct of the Boxleigh gas field.      TMOC owns 80 pct of the &lt;Moonie Pipeline Co Pty Ltd> which  owns and operates the Moonie to Brisbane oil pipeline.      TMOC also holds 25 pct of the Jackson to Moonie oil  pipeline, 20 pct owned by Santos. Output from the Naccowlah  block, 40 pct owned by Santos, provides the bulk of the  throughput of both pipelines.      TMOC has exploration interests in a number of areas in the  Amadeus, Surat, Eromanga and Canning basins.      It also has oil and gas interests in Britain's North Sea,  Ecuador, and the U.S., Along with gold and base metal  production through its associate &lt;Paringa Mining and  Exploration Co Plc>, Santos said.

gnp,"SEIPP SAYS GERMAN INTEREST RATES SHOULD FALL  The Bundesbank should take further  steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from  further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring  long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management  board chairman Walter Seipp said.      But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not  mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in  money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down  for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.      ""Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,"" he said.  ""The money market rates are the important ones.""      Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating  money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent  tender allocations.      An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of  credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary  growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of  the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital  formation, braking the expansion of money supply.      ""Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of  monetary growth both at the same time,"" he added.      Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a  picture of the German economy, since company profitability had  improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were  profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.      Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,  describing the downturn in production in the first months as a  false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.      After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the  economy should show an uptrend in the last three. ""We don't  believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a  'growth dip,'"" Seipp said.      But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal  policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should  be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.      The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January  were no substitute for support for growth.      Seipp added the federal government should make ""further  courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the  German economy and to increase its flexibility.""  "

nat-gas,"WORLD DEPENDENCY ON MIDEAST OIL SAID INEVITABLE  The world's dependency on the Mideast  as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going  to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> Director and  senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.      ""Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap  between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to  increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is  inevitable,"" McIvor said.      Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are  not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.      McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil  and gas exploration and production said that dependence would  result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when  the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.      ""Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25  billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only  about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,"" McIvor said.      ""The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the  remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is  producing at much less than current capacity,"" he added.      McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered  so far only 37 ""one-one thousandth of the total number contained  about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.""      McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not  believe there were any more ""super giants"", or oil fields with  reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which  would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency.      ""Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle  East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20  years and only two of these lie outside the middle east  (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)."" McIvor said.      McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S.  like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a  peak and would soon begin to decline.      But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty  of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the  Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and  Australia and Africa.      McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those  areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher  price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the  companies.      ""The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a  constant change in policies,"" McIvor said.      McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to  increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the  economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.      Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy  Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he  could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance  now but ""the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has  highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the  need to increase U.S. production.""      McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a  greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.      ""Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an  increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,""  McIvor said.      ""Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation  fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an  industrial fuel,"" he added.  "

The World Bank and other independent sources have said  inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986/87.      Syeduzzaman said remittances from expatriates would rise to  600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981/82.      Foreign exchange reserves at end-June are projected at 680  mln dlrs compared with 105 mln in 1981/82, he said.      Syeduzzaman said the export target has been set at 900 mln  dlrs this year against 626 mln in 1981/82. Commitments for  foreign loans and grants total more than five billion dlrs in  1986/87, against 3.54 billion five years previously, he said.

gnp,"HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET  Malaysia's recovery from the worst  recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the  government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988  after seven years of austerity, economists said.      ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,  an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International  Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for  faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""      Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking  one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.      The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under  two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct  because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.  Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and  semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.      The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion  ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.      Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct  in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.      Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen  blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.      One businessman said too many politicians give the  impression that Malaysia was unstable.      ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential  to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.      Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the  black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit  surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.      The government has said its fiscal policies will balance  the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.      The government will also repay some of its external debt,  which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.      Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt  ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential  goods are unlikely to change.      Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the  corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to  compete for investors with neighbouring states.  "

gnp,"GERMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE LOWERS GROWTH FORECAST  The DIW economic research institute  said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach  the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.      The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than  those of the other four leading German institutes, said the  economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its  prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.      The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national  product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in  real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter  of last year.       The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the  remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and  production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to  1.5 pct.      Other institutes and economists have recently revised their  forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.      In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that  the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand  healthy but foreign demand weak.      DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for  capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer  goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.      It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been  hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had  caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.      Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were  continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,  it said.      In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute  in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall  markedly this year.      However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change  from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further  improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared  with 1986, it said.

It said in its latest quarterly review that real gross  domestic product averaged an annual growth of 1.1 pct over the  first nine months of last year compared with a decline of 0.1  pct in the corresponding period in 1985.

gnp,"BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE  The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the  yen around its current range, a senior central bank official  told reporters.      He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris  last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current  ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar  rise.      Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency  stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other  policies and with other central banks, he said.      The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability  will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but  declined to be more specific.      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday  the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily  satisfactory for the Japanese economy.      Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the  official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a  completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.  Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government  officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.      The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross  national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in  the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little  changed from the performance expected this year.      Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but  the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of  nearly one percentage point, he said.      He said there was virtually no room for further monetary  policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance  in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.      The central bank's monetary policy has already done its  part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.  The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the  last year and a half.      Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of  inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.  ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may  still be wet,"" he added.      Liquidity among private households and especially the  corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.      The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock  exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds  into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may  continue, he said.  "
livestock,"EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT  Emergency action to distribute  European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved  so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a  permanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said.      Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores  between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the  scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.      The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes  of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has  been distributed to the needy through charities.      The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to  help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter  and will end on March 31.      But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether  to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.      The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary  scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units  (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)  ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.      However, commission sources said the real cost was small if  account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until  its quality and value deteriorates.      On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC  food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at  January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes  of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.  "

That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise  estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the  fourth quarter of 1985.      The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged  the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of  1986 over 1985.      The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly  reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total  decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the  department said.      The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending  decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an  increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.      Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after  a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter.

livestock,"AUSTRALIA EXPECTS RISE IN MEAT EXPORTS TO MIDEAST  Australia expects meat and livestock  exports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this  year, managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock  Corp, Peter Frawley, said.      He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and  less competition from the European Community should lead in the  Gulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000  tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year.      ""In the last three to four months there has been a  resurgence of inquiries,"" he said.      Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi  Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market  potential.      On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in European  Community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help  Australian sales.      The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these  markets, where the Australian trade was the natural source of  supply, and Australia was ""now back in,"" Frawley said.      He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the  Middle East market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirds  of meat export value to the area, would be maintained.      He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand  for fresh meat.      The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia,  the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with  2,939,226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United Arab  Emirates and Bahrain fell, however.      Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been  offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean.      Other than livestock, Australia's overall meat sales to the  Middle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes  the previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of  mutton and lamb to Iran.      Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being  virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several  years. Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a  barter provision, but Iran had paid in full in cash.      Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments were  currently under way, with Iran again seeking credit and barter  provisions, he said.      Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand  for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he  predicted this would continue.      ""The Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, is now  Australia's largest market for lamb, chilled and flown in.  Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if  the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh, young  product,"" he said.  "

gnp,"AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE  Australia's economy should manage modest  growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but  unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.      The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross  Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct  in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be  helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand  following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.      The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer  prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.      The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly  and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.      While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,  however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth  forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.      The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic  growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is  struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.      The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,  should again show growth over the next two years, rising by  0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.  "

livestock,"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA  The European Community (EC) agreed a  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC  officials said.      Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.      But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the  officials said.      The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.      Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the  officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade).      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had  been affected by the country's EC membership.      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the  fish dispute with Canada.      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied  with Japanese offers of compensation.      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told  journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)  concessions were not enough.""      ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.  "

gnp,"BELGIUM REVISES DOWN 1987 GNP GROWTH FORECASTS  The Belgian government has lowered its  forecast for the nominal increase in gross national product in  1987 to 3.5 pct from an originally forecast 3.9 pct, Prime  Minister Wilfried Martens said in a statement to parliament.      He said this revision, which brings government forecasts  more closely into line with those by private institutions,  takes account of an anticipated slowdown in the world economy  and international trade.      But he said the impact on the Belgian economy will be  limited due to recent agreements on wages and working  conditions agreed by employers and unions.      Martens did not say how much the government expected GNP to  grow in volume terms.      However, last month the government's Planning Bureau said  it had revised its 1987 forecast for this to 0.9 pct from 2.0  pct.      In 1986, Belgium's gross national product rose 2.15 pct in  volume terms against a 5.9 pct nominal rise.  "

""Based on past relationships, that gain is consistent with  stepped up growth in real GNP during the first half of 1987,""  Baldrige said.  "
gnp,"OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987  The 24 nations of the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by  sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest  hit by currency appreciation this year.      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes  increasingly ragged.      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last  year's 18.4 pct drop.      The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year  and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break  through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in  1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle  of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather  than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter  U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said.      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that  if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would  collapse.      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt  crisis, it said.      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly  sick.""      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in  December, the EIU said.      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more  competitively-priced dollar.      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.      However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over  the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices  will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first  time since 1984, the EIU said.      After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of  internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in  1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.      It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6  pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.  "

nat-gas,"JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS  The Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand  outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese  energy demand, ministry officials said.      MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600  mln, they said.      The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.      MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.      They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.

gnp,"MALAYSIAN CENTRAL BANK SEES HIGHER 1987 GROWTH  Gross domestic product (GDP)  growth in 1987 is expected to grow by between 1.5 and two pct,  up from one pct in 1986, the central bank said.      The forecast compares with the one pct GDP growth forecast  made by the Treasury last October.      Bank Negara also said in its annual report that gross  national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 3.5 to four pct,  after declining 7.3 pct in 1986.      It said that a turnaround in investor confidence since last  November had been spurred by a moderate improvement in oil and  commodity prices and a rise in manufacturing exports.      Growth in 1987 is expected to come from the anticipated  rise in export earnings if the industrialised countries sustain  their average GNP growth at 2.5 to three pct, it added.      Bank Negara said its forecast assumes that crude oil will  average 15.50 dlrs a barrel, rubber at 210 cents a kilo, palm  oil at 850 ringgit a tonne, tin at 17 ringgit a kilo and a rise  of 12 pct in manufacturing exports.      It said Malaysia's international terms of trade will turn  around to rise by two pct in 1987 after declining 12 pct in  1986 and five pct in 1985.

The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 1.19  billion ringgit in 1986 or 1.8 pct of GNP from 1.79 billion or  2.5 pct of the GNP the previous year.

livestock,"U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY  The U.S. meat and poultry inspection  programs are incapable of protecting consumers from  contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and  consumers charged.      ""The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has  been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the  public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated  meat,"" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of  Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.      ""The American consumer has little reason to feel confident  about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him  today,"" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community  Nutrition Institute.      ""Company management is less concerned about the risk to  health than about raising plant output and company profits,""  Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on  Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.      Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government  Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose  violations of federal law, demonstrating a ""serious breakdown in  the entire inspection system.""      Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being  contaminated by ""intestines dragging in a water trough used to  flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,  chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow  their noses.""      Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture  Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended  the government's program, calling it ""one of the most respected  public health programs in the world.""      FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5  billion chicken and turkeys every year.      Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with  change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in  the meat and poultry supply has increased.      He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium  salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time  and much money to contain the growing problem.      Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is  found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw  pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.      The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20  years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.      ""We certainly really have not found an effective means of  turning this disease around,"" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)      The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS  intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for  detecting microoganisms.      But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls  would cost too much.      ""Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily  complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real  goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and  economical meat supply for consumers,"" Stanley Emerling,  executive vice president of the National Association of Meat  Purveyors, said.      Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new  program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at  certain plants ""voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be  repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic  of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor  legal recourse.""      Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the  panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.  "

gnp,"FED'S JOHNSON STRESSES PRICE STABILITY  Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman  Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was  critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the  world and said that progress was being made.      ""It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's  promotion of price stability is critical to the successful  implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients  for growth,"" he told the Eastern Economic Association.      Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of  fronts. ""Federal Reserve monetary policy, the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the  Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the  right direction,"" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,  France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.      On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise  numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment  toward slowing the growth of federal spending.      There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National  Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.      But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign  capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep  interest rates stable.      ""This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.  Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive  federal spending,"" he said.      A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the  main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.      He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of  exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.      On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against ""quick fix""  solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation  or protectionist trade legislation.      ""What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy  returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine  economic growth,"" he said.      Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow  for its gradual resolution over time.  "

The company said its net crude oil and condensate  production averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to  251,300 bpd in 1985.      Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07  billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Net  natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,  down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.      Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was  12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in  1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs  per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.      Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas  declined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent  in 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said.      In the annual report, the company called for imposition of  an oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor price  of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil.      ""Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel      will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the rise  in imports,"" Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report.      ""Without decisive action in Washington, this nation will  once again become a hostage to OPEC's plans and policies,""  Hartley said.  "

gold,"""BRITANNIA"" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM  The new British one ounce gold coin, the  ""Britannia,"" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the  day of purchase plus a ""competitive premium,"" Treasury officials  said.      Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members  of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign  coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold  Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No  decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.      Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian  Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the  place of the South African krugerrand, the British government  still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one  ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at  present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.      Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used  in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be  bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be  difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.      No details are yet available on how many coins will be  issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that  the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.      There were some enquiries on the ""Britannia"" from coin  dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor  in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put  off many investors, traders said.      Some said that the ""Britannia"" had come too late, with the  Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins  already well established.  "
livestock,"AUSTRALIAN BEEF OUTPUT SEEN DECLINING IN 1987  Australian beef output is forecast to  decline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln  in 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and  Live-Stock Corp (AMLC) said.      Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to  480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and  then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of  its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts.      It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level  of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is  expected to be slower than previously forecast.      Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher  returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will  continue, the AMLC said.      The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is  expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and  domestic consumption this year, it said.      The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production  levels until late next year.      It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of  output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55  pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct.      The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of  production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the  Australian dollar, the AMLC said.      It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, the  U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the  chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively  around 94 pct of total Australian exports.  "

gnp,"NO FRENCH REFLATION, SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY  There is no question of stimulating  consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other  reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources  close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.      Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques  Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers  were agreed on the desirability of ""relaunching"" the economy.      This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a  reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled  out any such move.      The sources today said the government's policy remained one  of ""recovery,"" or sound finances and greater efficiency.      They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc  revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation  program will go to providing public companies with fresh  capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward  paying off national debt.      Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30  billion would be distributed between repayment of national  internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they  added.      The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when  the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this  year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as  fast as gross domestic product.      Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this  year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with  earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.      The sources said that with France's economic targets for  1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the  government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at  an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

He told a news conference that the government would soon  create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment  applications by local and foreign investors.      Praising the role of multinational companies and local  entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to  maintain a close working contact with the private sector.      The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in  1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the  country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and  rising real incomes, he added.      ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,  Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the  planning minister said.      Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable  weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises  announced in February, the minister added.      Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the  long rainy season, which is due to start about now.      Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops  increased during the second half of last year.

At a press conference yesterday, a Ministry spokesman  reported the deposit contained an estimated 44 mln tons of ore,  with each ton capable of containing 7,666 grams of gold. The  spokesman gave no estimate of what he thought the find,  discovered on Wednesday, was worth.      However, mining could only begin after foreign partners  invest eight mln dlrs needed for technical equipment, the  spokesman said.

In 1971, the Sedren copper mine in Gonaives, operated by a  Canadian firm, closed down after years of mining a concentrate  containing gold as well as copper.      ""The new Grand Bois mine represents large amounts of money,""  said a former official of Sedren Mine.      ""But like everything else there's a catch.

gnp,"GATT MEETING HEARS PLEA FOR AFRICAN DEBT RELIEF  Debt among African countries  will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless  developed countries lower their interest rates, Nigerian Trade  Minister Samaila Mamman said.      He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and  developing countries and an inequitable international economic  system were major impediments to growth in developing  countries.      Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in  the New Zealand resort of Taupo.      ""I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the  external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full  effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the  developed market economy countries,"" Mamman said.      ""The developed market economy countries have slowed down  output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity  exports of African countries.""      Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a  year would be needed over the next five years for the African  continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth  (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.      Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at  24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.      ""With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to  four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt  persists,"" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek  alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of  resources and more indebtedness, he said.      ""The international community cannot fail to respond  positively to the collapse of the international market for  commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices  of our commodity exports,"" he added.  "
gnp,"GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS  The global economy is expected to  weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious  poverty outlook, economic analysts said.      For finance ministers and central bankers attending this  week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund  and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an  additional concern.      The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct  this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.      In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a  measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to  2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.      For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,  another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0  pct from 3.5 pct last year.      The new figures are considered a major disappointment to  the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope  with growing mounds of debt.      IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.      Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.      Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier  states for markets for their products as well as financial  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations'   economies poses fundamental worries.      Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,  including the key one of exports.      The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only  2.3 pct, according to the IMF.      For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the  United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.      The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and  the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade  deficit.      Reagan administration officials have been saying that the  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much  slower than expected.      The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it has  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years  to get a resonably complete effect.""      The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take even  more time on this occasion.""  REUTER^M  "
nat-gas,"LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U.K. UPSTREAM PROFIT  &lt;Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on  exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in  1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices  last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.      But he told a press conference that due to the high  marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of  the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330  mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.      The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with  Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he  said.      As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and  production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.      Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell  Group &lt;RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,  up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against  8.81 mln.      Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil  output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,  which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the  company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the  current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline  in output from the major Brent field, he said.      Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas  liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to  be maintained in 1987, he said.      A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey  North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,  Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5  billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil  price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.      Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North  Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the  cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.      Day to day operating costs of the exploration and  production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target  is to keep costs per barrel constant.      The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to  the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to  gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.      Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a  profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.      Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;Shell  U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987  were a ""bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.""      In November and December in particular, refining operations  had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil  product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue  generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to  become negative from time to time, depending on price  movements.      A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will  now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five  months behind schedule, following a crane accident which  severely damaged the plant last year, he said.      Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from  11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical  site.      Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which  companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying  development expenditure on certain future oil fields against  PRT, was ""helpful,"" but rather less than had been hoped for.      Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in  the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he  would expect some over-production above OPEC""s official 15.8 mln  bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.      He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain  output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,  but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will  fall.  "

gnp,"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD  Japan's trade surplus is likely to  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  said.      In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the  OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while  export markets rose by only two pct.      But it said this differential between the growth of  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,  ""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""      It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct  in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.      The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand  and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.      The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure  on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus  weaken domestic growth.      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct  growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance  on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a  0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.  "

gnp,"FRENCH GDP SHOULD RISE 2.3 PCT IN 1988 - MINISTRY  French gross domestic product should grow  by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct  in 1986, the Finance Ministry said.      The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and  Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to  the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price  rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year  and 14.7 in 1986.      The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard  Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two  pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1  pct last year.      In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in  1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said.      Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this  year and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added.      Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two  years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct  of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986.      Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8  pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct  this year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise  in household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct and  last year's 2.9 pct.      Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year  this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector  productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct  rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986.      The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared  before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget,  which the government is now preparing for presentation in  September.  "
gnp,"SWISS 1988 INFLATION SEEN AT TWO PCT - INSTITUTE  Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987  and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic  economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal  Institute of Technology said in its spring review.      It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988  compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped  to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.      The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss  economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more  difficult international economic climate facing export  industry.      The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in  Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5  pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7  pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.      Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the  motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by  three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.      Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from  2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All  three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent  years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.      The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has  firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure  on Swiss exporters.      It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more  modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when  import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.      Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2  pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.  "
gold,"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS  Commodities from gold to grains to  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of  inflation and economic instability.      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term  direction of the currency markets.      ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If  they do, it's not evident.""      ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market  take values to where they should be.      ""One way or another, we will force our major trading  partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.      ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's  happening,"" he said.      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of  Dominick and Dominick.      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton  posted broad gains.      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate  export demand.      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately  higher.      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field  work to market animals.  "
gold,"BP &lt;BP> UNIT SEES MINE PROCEEDING  British Petroleum Co PLC said based on  a feasibility report from &lt;Ridgeway Mining Co>, its joint  venture Ridgeway Project in South Carolina could start  commercial gold production by mid-1988.      The company said the mine would produce at an approximate  rate of 158,000 ounces of gold per year over the first four  full years of operation from 1989 through 1992 and at an  average of 133,000 ounces a year over the full projected  11-year life of the mine.      BP's partner in the venture is Galactic Resources Ltd  &lt;GALCF> of Toronto.      The company said subject to receipt of all statutory  permits, finalization of financing arrangements and management  and joint venture review, construction of a 15,000 short ton  per day processing facility can start.  Capital costs to bring  the mine into production are estimated at 76 mln dlrs.  "
gnp,"AUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS  Domestic demand is now expected to make  no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal  1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all  of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.      However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic  Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise  in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.      But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this  financial year and net export growth will provide the total  source of gdp growth.      The August budget had forecast domestic demand would  contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5  pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.      Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic  parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a  slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit  than first anticipated.      ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit  for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that  the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said.      Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC  in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is  broadly on track, Keating said.      ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more  sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said.      ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more  than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth  in domestic production and employment.""      Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation  rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.      ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in  inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary  effects wane,"" he said.      Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick  up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in  net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from  private domestic demand.      He said domestic demand growth will be due to a  strengthening in real household disposable income.      The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year  should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level  broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.      ""The current account deficit will continue to show  improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said.      ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent  years recede further, and given continued effective wage  restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he  said.  "

The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the  request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached  for support.      Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an  interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: ""Denmark will not  accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach  an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC.""      Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns  in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community  totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs.      Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion  that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC  veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC.      But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said  the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC  regulations. ""Canadian officials are very concerned about the  trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the  EC and bilaterally,"" she added.  "

""It is my  intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy  council and the cabinet for consideration and review.""      He said proposals, including an increase in the oil  depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax,  should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at  the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.      ""The goal of the Administration policies is to increase  domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels  a year.""      The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday  warning the United States was threatened by a growing  dependence on oil imports.      ""We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65  pct by 1995,"" Herrington said.      He said it was too soon to say what the Administration  policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would  be opposition to tax changes.      ""Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options  would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the  tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been  favored by the administration. I think what we need is to  debate this within the Administration,"" he said.      He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.

gnp,"BONN SERIOUS ABOUT CURRENCY PACT, SAYS TIETMEYER  West Germany takes ""very seriously"" the  recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote  exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry  State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.      Talking to journalists before a meeting of European  Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer  declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the  Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements  for stabilising currencies.      But he noted the official communique said the participants  agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange  rates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence very  seriously,"" he said.      Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against  the mark since the meeting.      He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been  caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris  agreement should help in this respect.      Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the  Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the  economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and  had not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary.      Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion  by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the  economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.      The Commission has sharply revised down expected German  gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct  predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC  country to stimulate economic activity.      Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed  in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of  1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in  view that would make quick remedial action necessary.      He said a number of favourable indicators such as high  level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a  recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up  slightly during the course of the year.

The company said the study found proven ore reserves of  3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It  said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per  year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three  years for a rapid payback of capital costs.      It said the feasibility study calls for gold production  averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and  50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000  ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life.      Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment  and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firm  said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner  but the associated mill by Geodome.      Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not  included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine  holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of  gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton.      Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade  material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for  gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price.

gnp,"CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY  Canadian economic growth is expected to  slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should  keep the country from recession, economists said.      ""The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth  over the course of 1987,"" said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at  Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.      Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,  grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,  but down from 1985's four pct.      In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized  rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the  third quarter.      ""Essentially it is a flat performance,"" said Warren Jestin,  deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.      Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson  Bongard Inc said ""it shows the economy is not moving along very  steadily, it's not a very promising number.""      ""We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter  in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession,"" she  added.      The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by  Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last  month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this  year.      Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will  likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.      Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade  performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in  the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs  from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.      ""The sharp increase in the deficit originated from  merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to  advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged,"" the  federal agency said in a statement.      The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion  dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.      But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.  economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and  help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of  Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.  "

The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut  Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national  product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually  during the seven-year period to 1993.      If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This  scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.      It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy  and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.  "
gnp,"JAPAN OCTOBER/DECEMBER GNP RISES 0.8 PCT  Japan's gross national product (GNP) rose  a real 0.8 pct in the October/December quarter after an  upwardly revised 0.7 pct increase the previous three months,  the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.      The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been  put at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2  pct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September.      In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7  pct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worst  since 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct. Agency officials blamed the  strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry.      In nominal terms, GNP rose 0.5 pct in the October/December  quarter, reflecting stable prices, after a one pct increase in  the previous three months, the Agency said.      Domestic real demand increased 0.6 pct in October/December,  after a one pct rise the previous quarter.      Domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage point to real  GNP growth in October/December, while foreign trade added 0.2.  The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding.      In July/September, domestic demand contributed one  percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off  0.3 point.      Of the 0.2 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last  quarter, falling exports knocked off 0.2 while falling imports  contributed 0.4 point.      Total export volume fell 1.2 pct quarter on quarter in  October/December. Imports also fell, by 2.9 pct.      Of the 0.5 point contribution of domestic demand to  October/December GNP growth, the private sector accounted for  0.4 point and the public sector, 0.2.      The private sector contribution included 0.3 point for  housebuilding, 0.4 for corporate capital outlays and 0.1 for  stockbuilding. Consumer spending had a 0.4 negative impact.  "

gnp,"GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED  Figures for first quarter 1987 West  German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were  provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal  Statistics Office said.      The official said there had been a delay in gathering  information for the data, which are expected to show that the  West German economy contracted in the period.      A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there  was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on  June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.      ""There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical  matter,"" he added.      The West German government is expected to come under  pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners  to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international  trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.      However, government officials have ruled out any further  tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of  stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.      Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German  central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the  widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real  terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first  quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.       The government has confirmed that growth was negative in  the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to  be about two pct.      Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to  cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,  at three pct, is just above historical lows.      West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice  summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,  is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered  from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over  two years.      The government has pointed out that depressed exports are  the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but  says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will  compensate for this setback.      It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under  two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.  "

gnp,"U.K. GROWTH RATE SEEN AT THREE PCT THIS YEAR  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel  Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament,  said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar  1987.      He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of  payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1  billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct  at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by  the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the  year.      The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged  when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,  Lawson said.      Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling  M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be  taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as  the exchange rate.      The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to  the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the  corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business  sector in particular.      On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier  assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per  barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the  PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.  "

gnp,"U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT  Senior U.S. Economic officials  disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget  deficit reduction targets.      Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic  Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to  a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting  spending and fostering economic growth.      By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional  Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the  deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.      Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University  that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the  desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility  for local projects to state governments.      He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the  President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to  limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should  be linked more closely.      Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct  growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and  3.5 pct in 1988.      Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of  economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty  good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.""      He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,  ""It looks like they're on track.""      While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,  Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.      The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax  reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will  greatly increase private production incentives, he said.      ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest  national net output of goods and services will permanently  increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run  consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would  have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the  income of the average American family.""      Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible  for the large increase in the budget deficit.      In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted  to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of  GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.      Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986  federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points  higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.      ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981  tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget  deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said.      ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax  increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added.      However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner  argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.      ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes  enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the  Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence  spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)  are unpleasant,"" he said.      Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological  turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation  in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread  distrust of government.      ""The American people turned on the government with tax  revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at  the national level,"" Penner said.      ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike  of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake  demands that the system change a lot.""      Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget  deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will  remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.      He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is  not likely to succeed.      ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to  dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply  because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said.      Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget  deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated  by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes  related to tax reform and sales of government assets.      ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative  timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last  day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved  more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said.  "

The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for  poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef  cattle raising, Ministry officials said.      Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87  against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were  217,554 tonnes against 224,101.      Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes  from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.      The officials said corn imports rose because the world  surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced  Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in  1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.      Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87  from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from  18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due  to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as  Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.      Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and  the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.      The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from  increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.      Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against  528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct  from 2.1 pct.  "

""There's been a tug of war between the (currency)  speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it  looks like the game has gone to the speculators,"" said John Ing  at Maison Placements Canada Inc.      The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today  against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central  banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said.      A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the  traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted.      Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd,  noted that ""a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars.  If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold.""      A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing  said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a  four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct.      Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its  current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an  average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael  Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs,  with a possible spike above 500 dlrs.      However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far  faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself,  causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere  in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign  the buying pressure is slowing down. ""The stocks have run an  incredible way,"" Cohen said.

gnp,"FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax  reform will not affect his determination to reign in  expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline  in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.      ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,""  Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.      Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs  in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he  forecast in the February budget.      And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was  expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32  billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.      Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year  higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income  support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated  revenues.      But finance department documents show the pace of deficit  reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and  1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the  transition to the reformed taxation system.      The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in  fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1  billion dlrs in 1991.      Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian  economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct  this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an  actual 3.1 pct.      Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around  the current four pct level over the next two years.  "

""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise  its farm import market,"" he said.      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to  protect local farmers.      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year  beef accord next March 31.      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing  some one billion dlrs in new business.      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the  industrial sector.      ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these  issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official  said.  "

It said in a report that because of an economic recovery  and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is  unlikely to face devaluation in the near future.      The report was presented at a two-day investment conference  organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks.      The report said rising commodity prices and the continued  expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous  fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for  cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy.      It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60  and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the  year.      But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external  debt remains worrying and should be controlled.

gnp,"WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN  A confidential World Bank report on the  Peruvian economy has said the government's strategy does not  offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is  likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.      The report, published today by the economic monthly, The  Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia's  government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth  in gross domestic product of over eight pct ""represents gains in  the short term at the expense of the long.""      Government officials had no immediate comment on the  report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the  public investment program and greater emphasis on the  preservation of Peru's export potential.      The report said that although the government had succeeded  in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of  1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation  program was encountering rising difficulties.      ""An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to  monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of  price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added.      The world bank report said the government's policies had  reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at  the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the  currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses,  and sharply diminished creditworthiness.      It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a  competitive exchange rate and control the public sector  deficit, ""the higher the probability will be that the government  will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of  domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further  controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the  balance of payments.""      It said the bank would place more emphasis on the  preservation of peru's export potential, external links and  overall economic efficiency.      The government's incentive policies towards the mining and  petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports,  suggested that it did not accord high priority to their  economic viability, it added.

gnp,"GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS  The West German government's independent  council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of  the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm  Ost said.      A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor  Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council  said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two  pct was achievable.      It added the council believed ""an intensification of the  already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial  policy is not called for.""      Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on  West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not  increase.      The government regularly uses the term ""changed external  economic factors"" when referring to the fall of the dollar,  which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials  have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but  could still fall below the 1986 level.      Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany  agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in  February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.      The stance taken by the experts backs up the official  position of the West German government ahead of next week's  seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be  pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.      West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not  in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due  next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.      The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official  interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.      The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of  between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a  forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.      Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987  predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government  itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,  compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.  "
gold,"U.S. GOLD EAGLE SALES PROJECTED AT 3.1 MLN OUNCES  American Eagle gold bullion coin  sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year  on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope,  director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists.      World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193  mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world  market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.      Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold  Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in  Europe and about eight pct in Asia.      She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion  coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve  the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.      The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,  as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining  gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the  open market, Pope said.      Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here  from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from  the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's  West German market share at 60 pct.      The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy  gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct  value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce  coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.      Competition may also come from new gold coins, including  Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia  also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.  "

The proposed boost is based on a government forecast that  gross national product (gnp) will grow by more than 7.5 pct and  the gnp deflator by 3.5 pct in 1988, against targets of 8.0 pct  and 3.5 pct respectively this year, they said.

gnp,"WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS  The five leading West German economic  research institutes said the government should do more to  stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of  tax cuts planned for 1990.      In their joint spring report the institutes were divided  about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct  expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national  product grew 2.4 pct last year.      But the report said all the institutes believed that ""more  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional  jobs can be created.""      The institutes said any step which improved basic economic  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From this  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be  brought forward.""      The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion  marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.      However, the institutes criticised the government, not only  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of  its financing had been left open.      The government has not specified how the remaining 19  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.      The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a  quick decision from the government.      They also said the government should reduce tax  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in  value-added tax.      The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.      They referred specifically to a doubling of special  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this  as an increase in subsidies.      The institutes said total subsidies, including tax  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen  further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it  should be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" to  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.      The institutes said that if the government raised value  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.      The report also noted that the government was progressing  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and  said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim  for more competition, it said.  "

gnp,"BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING  A trade-led boom in the U.S. is  unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will  merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and  other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its  latest economic report.      Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,  after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will  contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.      As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5  pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,  the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.      ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop  dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause  a falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.      Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8  pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.      The report was released before the Commerce Department  reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,  after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal  consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with  a 0.6 pct increase the month before.      The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost  consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9  pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.      This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income   growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.      As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power  of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs  this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.      The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing  starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in  1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.      ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988  or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.      Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an  improvement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes on  the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" he  added.  "

The institutes were divided in their spring report on  forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and  two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.      Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,  ""None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the  beginning of a recession."" He added, however, that exports  remained the weak point of the economy .      Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further  encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.      Arthur Krumper of Munich's Ifo institute, which with the  DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of  the economy, said, ""The braking effects (on the economy)  produced by external factors will remain considerable for most  of the year.""

It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no  case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if  the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the  state-federal cooperative eradication program.      To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle  population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.      There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands,  classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated  brucellosis.

nat-gas,"TENNECO &lt;TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS  Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline  Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport  natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, FERC.      In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport  company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also  transport its own gas to customers.      Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC  guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the  regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for  gas it has bought but could not sell.      The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay  contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term  contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as  customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.      Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that  Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to  open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.      But Tenneco today said open access ""is one of the steps  FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC  is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even  before all transitional problems are solved.""      A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure  under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure  for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from  Louisiana and Texas up to New England.      ""We remain convinced that the most critical transitional  issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by  FERC in the near future.      ""A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the  industry's continued ability to provide its customers with  reliable natural gas,"" said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co  president R.C.

Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March  23 to April 22, and the new shares will be quoted from June 4.      BHP said the new company will be one of Australia's larger  gold producers, with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces. It  said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by  the early 1990s. BHPGM's portfolio will include several  Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer, 100 pct of Ora Banda and  Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development.

Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven  reserves that could be mined without future development costs.      Proven reserves as of December 31, 1985 were 978,000 tons  grading an average of 0.194 ounces of gold a ton, equivalent to  about two years future production.  "
livestock,"ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY  A study of salmonella poisoning has  uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding  antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that  can infect humans and resist medicines.      Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control  tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is  resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the  resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote  the growth of cattle.      Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of  antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have  been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs  is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.      Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases  that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect  humans.      But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England  Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.      The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number  of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant  infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to  298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the  victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized  for their illness.      They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always  prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating  raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, ""the  majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating  hamburger that was at least partially cooked.""      The researchers said the results show that ""food animals are  a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections  in humans, and that these infections are associated with  (antibiotic) use on farms.""  "
gnp,"FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS  French industry is failing to produce the  goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left  the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the  economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development said.      With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct  this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb  to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9  pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.      The report said the French economy was ""increasingly  ill-adapted to demand"" selling goods at ""uncompetitive relative  prices on both domestic and export markets.""      ""France's poor export performance reflects a geographical  bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...  And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18  months,"" it said.      Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit  to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,  it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the  franc could lead to ""a (renewed) loss of competitiveness  relative not only to the United States but also to the newly  industrialised countries.""      This could result in further major losses of market share,  particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a  quarter of French exports, it said.      Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the  authorities would have ""little scope for macroeconomic  manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to  encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow  more briskly,"" it added.      But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage  demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a  two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.      Written mainly in December last year, the report took no  account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct  surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the  government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.      ""We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke  runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has  been lost,"" one OECD official commented.      OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil  prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the  report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast  to around 2.5 or three pct.      The government last week revised its forecast up to between  2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.      But the OECD backed the government's view that the  underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,  with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's  fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of  disinflation.      With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in  the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and  its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one  pct this year, it said.      On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for  industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply  as companies built up their profits.      ""For the disinflationary process to continue , and price  competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange  rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,""  it said.  "

The company said the transactions will bring immediate  production and earnings to Consolidated TVX, enhance its  precious metal potential and is expected to improve cash flow  and earnings on a per share basis. The company did not give  specific figures.      Consolidated TVX said it will acquire 29 pct of CMP, a  public gold mining company in which TVX already holds a 15 pct  interest, making TVX the largest single shareholder.      The company also agreed to acquire a 19 pct stake in Novo  Astro, a private company, and a 16 pct interest in Teles Pires  Mining, increasing the TVX's ownership to 51 pct.      In addition, Consolidated TVX said it will acquire the  right to add a 10 pct interest to a platinum property in which  it already owns a 29.4 pct stake.      CMP earned 11 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986 and expects to  produce 42,000 ounces of gold in 1987 at a cost of 160 U.S.  dlrs an ounce, Consolidated TVX said.      Novo Astro operates Brazil's richest gold mine located in  Amapa State, with an average grade of 0.8 ounces of gold a ton  in a hardrock quartz vein, Consolidated TVX said. Mining of  eluvial surface material produced 25,000 ounces in 1986 and is  expected to produce 60,000 ounces in 1987.      It also said Teles Pires Mining controls rights to a 350  kilometer section of the Teles Pires River, where one dredge is  expected to produce 10,000 ounces of gold in 1987.  "

livestock,"LITTLE EFFECT SEEN FROM COLD STORAGE REPORT  The USDA monthly cold storage report  for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on  livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of  direction, livestock analysts said.      The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the  22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may  provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.      ""I think the market is going to be looking at some other  things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might  be early next week,"" Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH  Miller, said.      Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures  will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog  marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was  completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest  for pork in general next week.      ""We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert  a possible setback next week in the pork complex,"" Levitt said.      Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly  figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were  down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average  expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline  from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings,  they said.      However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in  storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is  a potentially bullish situation.      Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri,  said, ""I would not look for (belly) storage during the next  month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be  less.""  "
gnp,"OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT  The United States should take urgent  action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible  reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on  growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development said.      The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,  said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress  quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriously  affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""      It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,  running until September 30 this year, would substantially  overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion  dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.      ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of  slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the  first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190  billion dollars,"" it said.      While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's  deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax  increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.      The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to  2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.      In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports  boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.      Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service  sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be  heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer  prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next  year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.      ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors  behind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.      The current account balance of payments deficit is expected  to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after  hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.      In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly  to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will  still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is  expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,  unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct  this year.      Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to  around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about  that level in 1988.  "

The report states that total net proved reserves at year's  end stood at 2.5 billion barrels, an increase of 94 mln barrels  or four pct above the previous year and detailed data show that  the gains resulted from an increase in net proved reserves of  natural gas liquids.      Mobil said gains were in Indonesia where a sixth production  facility began operation in October with a capacity to  manufacture 1.7 mln tonnes of liquified natural gas.      The company also said that new capacity brought onstream  last year replaced 120 pct of Mobil's production, which  declined by about four pct in 1986 from the previous year.

gnp,"BANGEMANN REJECTS CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS  West German Economics Minister Martin  Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading  economic research institutes for early introduction of a major  tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.      In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint  spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for  bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --      ""The government points out that the positive effects for  growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget  deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered.""      Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned  for 1988 had already been increased.      Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,  with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct  growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.      Bangemann said ""The government, agreeing with the majority,  sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for  exports expressed by the minority.""      He said there was reason to believe that export demand  would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because  of a further increase in world trade.  "
livestock,"U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES  The United States is prepared to ""pull out  all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador  to GATT Michael Samuels said.      Those rights are now being challenged by the European  Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a  conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.      He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if  the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without  the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.      The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect  on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat  shipments into the EC.      The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.  trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed  prices over the current market level and which may be extended  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.      Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade  negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be  erected,"" Samuels said.      Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""  and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is  unrealistic.      The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally  next week.      The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals  substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of  farm subsidies.      The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major  trade distortions, Samuels said.      Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally  submitted and respond to it officially then.      ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""  the U.S. Ambassador said.      The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores  the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.      The key difference between the two approaches is that the  U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing  only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.      If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to  correct the international trade situation, he added.      Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC  oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the  U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

gold,"NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD  A new market has emerged in warrants to  buy gold, a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play  of commodity options into the field of securities.      Over the past three weeks, Swiss offices of American banks  have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying  conditions, drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the  recovery of the gold price last year.      And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each  issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a  similar character, though they are aimed at a less professional  market.      The market is still small. Taken together, the four  American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss  francs.      But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and  predicted a lively future.      Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank (Switzerland) AG  said: ""The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a  long-term investment in gold with limited risk.""      Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on  February 27, following it up with a second issue less than a  week later. The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA.      The idea found some quick copies. Goldman Sachs in Zurich  organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque  Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty  (Switzerland) AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of  New York.      The four issues now offer investors striking prices for  gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce, the  same price as the underlying commodity, to a 430 dlr level on  the first one for Citibank.      The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities  from 18 months to four years and three months, in all cases  longer than gold futures and options on U.S. Markets.      The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to  the February report of U.S. Consumer prices for January, when a  jump of 0.7 pct raised again the threat of inflation.      ""Many people are worried about inflation again,"" said Mats  Joensson of Goldman Sachs. ""Money supply in Germany and the  United States has grown very strongly in the last year and  people want to take a ride on gold.""      The gold market, having seen strong gains in 1986, has  languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few  weeks. But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more  highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited.      Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in  Switzerland. ""People here understand gold, and they understand  warrants,"" he said.      Citicorp (Switzerland) pioneered warrants with a series of  equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares  over the past two years, and last autumn, Swiss banks launched  covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give  foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed  to all but Swiss citizens, and to play it with higher leverage.      But after a quick flurry of issues, that market dried up  when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks.      The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple  premiums, but on implicit volatility models devised to provide  scientific comparisons between titles in the options market.      Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his bank's issue was  competitive despite its relatively high premium. The issue, for  five ounces at 425 dlrs, was priced at 955 Swiss francs, making  a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct.      Using a Black Sholes options model, he said the issue's  long, 4.3-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit  volatility of gold of only 24.5 pct for the option to pay off,  which he claimed was lower than the other issues.      But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used  pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and  emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science.      And each bank, using its own model, put the implicit  volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct.      Whatever the calculation, the issues have received a warm  welcome from investors.      Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand,  even among small investors, who were buying 15 or 20 warrants  apiece. ""The most sophisticated ones wouldn't buy these because  the premiums are too high,"" he said.  "
gnp,"S.KOREA SEES GNP GROWTH MORE THAN 10 PCT THIS YEAR  South Korea's gross national product (GNP)  will exceed 10 pct real growth this year and the won will rise  further as long as the current account surplus continues to  widen, Deputy Prime Minister Chun In-Yong told reporters.      Chung, who is also Minister of Economic Planning, said his  GNP estimate was based on the assumption that the economy will  remain stable.      The official target for 1987 GNP growth is eight pct.      GNP rose 15.6 pct between the first quarters of 1987 and  1986, according to provisional Bank of Korea figures.      GNP rose 12.5 pct in calendar 1986.      In the first four months of this year, the current account  swung to a surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs from a deficit of 294  mln dlrs in the same 1986 period.      ""What the Minister said does not imply any major economic  policy change,"" a Ministry spokesman told Reuters. ""But he tried  to urge business circles to prepare for the forseeable economic  (future) ... A high won era.""      South Korean manufacturers, who have insisted the won  should not rise more than seven pct this year, have said they  plan to ask the government to slow down its appreciation  against the dollar.      The Bank of Korea today quoted the won unchanged at 812.05  against the dollar, a 6.02 pct gain so far this year compared  with a 3.34 pct increase for the whole of 1986.      The won strengthened by 6.60 won to the dollar in three  days earlier this month while an International Monetary Fund  team held talks here to discuss revaluation.  "

gold,"ST. JOE GOLD &lt;SJG> TO DEVELOP MINE  St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to  proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property  in northwestern Ontario.      It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue  underground development and obtain operating permits and  another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete  underground development, construct a mill and provide the  infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial  production.      St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were  granted in time, it would start gold production in the second  half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of  about 40,000 troy ounces.      The company said the property is estimated to contain over  500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project  covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves  of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.      It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150  tons of ore daily.      St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been  tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and  exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and  the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property.      The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver  deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has  been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading  0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.   It said preliminary results are encouraging and a feasibility  study is nearing completion.  "
gnp,"JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH  Prospects for world economic growth remain  very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is  urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize  currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.      ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,  and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments  imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its  gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.      The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of  western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only  2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's  2.5 pct growth rate.      ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area  comfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of the  OECD's economics and statistics department, said.      The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising  inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,  Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world  debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic  downturn.      ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth  remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major  countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest  rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible  labor markets.      But private sector confidence had been undermined by  uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for  confidence to be restored, it is important for governments  swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""      This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord  of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.      The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major  countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to  undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal  policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand  in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.      Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced  recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works  and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this  process, though it was too early to estimate its precise  impact.      He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic  demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.      The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has  worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast  to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct  increase in 1986.      There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the  unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the  average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last  year.      The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world  agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from  price guarantees and other measures linked to production  towards direct income support for farmers.

nat-gas,"SOUTH AFRICAN FIRM TO CONTINUE TESTS  South Africa's state-owned energy  firm Soekor said it would continue tests after striking oil  some 120 kms (75 miles) south-southwest of Mossel Bay.      During production tests, about 5,000 barrels of oil and  five mln cubic feet of gas per day were produced, it said.      ""This oil discovery will be followed-up as soon as possible  by further seismic surveys and drilling. Should further  drilling and tests in the area yield positive results oil  production from a floating platform could be considered.""      Director General of Mineral and Energy Affairs Louw Alberts  announced the strike earlier but said it was uneconomic.  "
gnp,"ECONOMISTS SEE SLUGGISH JAPANESE ECONOMY AHEAD  The Japanese economy will remain sluggish  in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for  12 years in 1986, private economists said.      Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,  was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and  business investment would help sustain the economy this year,  the economists said.      They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency  report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec  quarter for the first time in 12 years.      The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real  0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the  previous quarter.      It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from  4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst  performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake  of the first oil crisis.      They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in  consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was  only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had  depressed retail sales.      But most private economists disagreed and said consumers  were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw  their real income level off.      ""Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or  heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but  they have done so because they have become even more uneasy  about their future pay rises,"" said Shoji Saito, general manager  of Mitsui Bank's economic research division.      He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of   falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit  hard by the yen's rise.      Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said  weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.  Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve  domestically generated economic growth as the government has  put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.      Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in  Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including  exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen  Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,  said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec  resulted from an issue of gold coins.      ""This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that  high level of public-sector consumption in the following  quarter,"" Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending  would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which  marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.      Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current  quarter given the lack of additional significant government  spending and sluggish consumer spending.      Saito said the most effective government action would be  income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a  proposed controversial sales tax.  "

gnp,"CANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH  Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he  expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming  year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of  1986.      ""We see moderate growth,"" Crow told a news conference  following presentation of the central bank's annual report in  the House of Commons today.      He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,  particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth  quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic  product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.      Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that  inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy  and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's  inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.      The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound  despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in  debt plagued countries such as Brazil.      ""It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I  think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact,"" Crow told  reporters.  "
gnp,"FED SEEN CONTENT WITH U.S. FEBRUARY ECONOMY  U.S. February reports reflecting slim  gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures  reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue  to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.      ""If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything,"" said  Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.      ""There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation  front, all is well,"" he said. ""Money supply is well under  control. It's an absolutely ideal situation.""      February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly  less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.  This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production  number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.      The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,  less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct  rise in the PPI in January.      ""The Fed is going to look at this positively,"" said Allan  Leslie of Discount Corporation. ""Certainly inflation is not as  bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial  production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants.""      The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in  February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.      ""This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation  is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per  barrel,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""The  trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year.""      In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct  decline in the PPI.      Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,  but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices  fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.      Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that  a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both  the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.      ""The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations  today,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.      While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier  monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this  could necessitate a weaker dollar.      ""The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,"" he  said. ""We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with  foreign producers.""      Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct  in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced  overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising  prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.      If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish  overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might  necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.      By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8  pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to  a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value  of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.      Slifer said import prices may rise further as  manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped  to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that  reflect a weaker dollar.      David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported  manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the  second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.  industrial output.      ""It's the other side of the lower dollar,"" Wyss said.  ""Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive  and they are increasing output.""      Wyss said that the latest data point to an average  industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.  ""It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is  beginning to revive.""      But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not   convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He  said much of the strength came from factors that do not point  to a sustained rise in industrial output.      Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm  equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in  February business equipment production.      Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2  pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy  was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.      Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for  half of the industrial production gain as production of auto  assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5  million units.      ""In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are  producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at  roughly a seven mln unit rate,"" Roach said. ""The disparity  between output and sales is showing up in inventories.""      Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business  inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping  demand in the first quarter of 1987.      January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain  since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce  Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the  largest monthly sales drop on record.      Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to  month-to-month changes. ""The Fed has been standing pat for the  last seven months,"" Ramirez said. ""They will continue to stand  pat for at least the next couple of months.""  "
gnp,"MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9  The U.S. economy in March improved at a  faster rate than in February, with the National Association of  Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from  51.9 pct, the NAPM said.      The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.  The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the  rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national  product growth of about three pct.      An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the  economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a  declining economy.      The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all  of the indicators in the index except inventories, which  declined slightly.      New orders rose sharply in March, with production also  higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy  improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since  August 1984.      Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey  committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes  Inc &lt;PBI> said ""the economy ended the first quarter with a  healthy, if not substantial improvement.""      Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in  March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.      Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they  were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of  those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at  2.5 pct.      The estimated average price increase anticipated by members  for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to  rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as  being significant.      The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based  on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,  production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.      The monthly report is based on questions asked of  purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.  "

This compares with a 1.1 pct fall in the fourth quarter of  1985.      Compared with the year-earlier quarter, GDP also rose 1.1  pct, the Bureau figures show.      The annual rise compares with a 0.3 pct fall in the third  quarter compared with the 1985 third quarter and a 4.3 pct rise  in the year-earlier period, the Bureau figures show.      Real non-farm gross product rose 0.9 pct in the fourth  quarter after zero growth in the third quarter and a 1.3 pct  fall a year earlier, making an annual rise of 0.8 pct.      Gross farm product rose 4.3 pct compared with rises of 2.6  pct in the third quarter and 2.8 pct a year earlier, making  annual growth of 6.6 pct.      Elements in the fourth quarter GDP rise included falls of  0.6 pct and 0.2 pct in private and government final consumption  expenditure respectively, the Bureau figures show.      Gross fixed capital expenditure fell 0.1 pct in the quarter  while exports of goods and services rose 13.0 pct and imports  2.9 pct.      Seasonally-adjusted expenditure on GDP at average 1979/80  prices rose to 36.67 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter from  36.26 billion in both the third quarter and the year-earlier  quarter.

Rain was reported across parts of Minnesota, Iowa, eastern  Kansas, Missouri and eastern Oklahoma, with showers and a few  thundershowers extending from Arkansas through the lower  Mississippi Valley to Alabama and northwest Florida.      Strong winds of 20 to 35 mph with some stronger gusts were  reported across much of the Plains, causing considerable  blowingand drifting snow. A blizzard warning continued this  morning across most of western Kansas. A winter storm warning  was issued this morning over central and northeast Nebraska.      Weather advisories were posted for this morning over  central Kansas and central and southeast sections of South  Dakota where two to five inches of snow could accumulate.      Locally heavy rains accompanied the storm over portions of  the central Plains. Flash flood watches were issued for this  morning across the eastern half of Kansas.      A flood warning continues today for eastern Nebraska.  Widespread lowland and small stream flooding is expected to  continue over most of eastern Nebraska through Wednesday.      Due to cold, damp and windy conditions, livestock  advisories were posted this morning across central and  southeast portions of South Dakota.      As the storm moves north across the central Plains, winter  storm watches were issued over south central South Dakota, late  tonight and Wednesday over west central Minnesota.      Elsewhere, a travelers advisory remains in effect this  morning over northeast New Mexico and the Oklahoma and Tecas  Panhandle for blowing snow and slick roadways and across the  mountains and deserts of southern California for strong gusty  winds of 25 to 40 mph.

nat-gas,"OIL EXECUTIVES SEE GRADUAL RISE IN PRICES  Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT>  and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB> said they expected world oil prices to  gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on  imports of oil from the Middle East grows.       ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a  trend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president of  Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the  Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.       Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of  Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the  rate of 80 pct of capacity.      The gain will come largely through increased imports to the  United States, he said.      ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do not  think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nance  said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.       Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted  that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20  dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in  1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb  from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between  1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.       ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in  increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's  outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law  prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants  and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15  pct, he said.       Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may  experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next  winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.       Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20  pct during 1986, he said.       ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said.  ""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is  how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three  years before we start to climb out?""        J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent  improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent  producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.       ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr  per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore  exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by  independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.       He suggested that some independents may instead turn to  exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out  agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held  finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,  Walter said.  "

nat-gas,"COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY  Columbia Gas Transmission  corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if  its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.      Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary  said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a  proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent  purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.      Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial  ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative  filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to  include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or  consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing  and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.      The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover  about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales  commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on  recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,  beginning April 1, 1987.      Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline  commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.      The company said it orginially sought to include these  costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in  almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were  not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.      It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April  10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay  buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing  under the Natural Gas Act.      As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,  Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price  paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs  per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April  1985.      The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct  of its total available gas supply this year.  "

It said it believed Bulolo was not fully exploited in the  past, noting the literature refers to heavy gold losses in  tailings during dredging from 1931 to 1967 which produced a  total of 2.1 mln ounces.      City Resources also said previous dredging was only carried  out to a depth of 36 metres and high grade gold values are  reported to at least 60 metres in the central part of the  Bulolo Valley and possibly as deep as 90 metres.      In its productive life, recovered average grade at Bulolo  was 0.3 rpt 0.3 grams a tonne from some 207 mln cubic metres of  gravel, it said. City Resources will act as operator.      The Bulolo field, in Morobe Province, was the first  successful gold mining operation of &lt;Placer Development Ltd>  after it was floated in Canada in 1926. It operated the field  until dredging ceased in 1967.  "
gold,"LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL  The elimination of price limits on  precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in  New York appears to be having little effect on the market,  analysts said.      ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.  ""The market has not approached the old price limits and trading  is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he added.      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on  market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker  in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.      On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two  contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver  futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.      During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and  down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to  rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts  said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much  confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.      The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms  a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades  in a timely manner.      Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the  nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.      O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX  metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts  could move any distance.      ""This is amore realistic approach because the metals market  is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""  O'Neill said.      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic  buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.  "
gnp,"SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS  The Soviet Union outlined its economic  targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve  standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.      Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a  planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent  to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a  planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the  output of a country's goods and services.      He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is  essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on  world markets.      ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987  compared with the same period last year.      However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned  for the industry for the whole of 1988.      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to  a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale  measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.      Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same  figure as was announced last year.      Western governments view official Soviet estimates for  defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure  is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are  intertwined with the civilian economy.      Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending  next year on medical services, education, pensions and social  insurance schemes.  "

gnp,"MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC  European Community finance ministers  discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many  said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too  pessimistic.      The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago  cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3  per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.      It said economic prospects had been less promising over the  past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the  dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would  restrain Community exports.      But diplomats said several member states, led by West  Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,  especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement  between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise  currencies around current levels.      ""Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather  too pessimistic,"" said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,  who chaired the meeting.      The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West  Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it  feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to  stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.      But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto  Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at  the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.      The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France,  while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view  that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth.  "

gnp,"GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS  Senior officials in the West German  coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would  be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made  by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's  international monetary conference in Paris.      Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social  Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also  attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and  Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion  mark reduction would represent net tax relief.      An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.      The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts  already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.      Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief  would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal  increase in income tax.      An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers  1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose  children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the  tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by  increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and  medium-sized companies.      The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of  a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect  in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this  reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would  be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.      The West German government had come under pressure from the  United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But  Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while  the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of  growth was uncertain.      The government said in January it was aiming for real  growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some  economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.      Stoltenberg said: ""We remain on a course of expansion.  Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,  or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to  three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few  days ago, remains open at the moment.""

Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study  averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart  Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all  the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained  less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.      Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the  established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat  content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.      Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs  for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy  between the study and the USDA handbook.      ""Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information  that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The  statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today  which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,  thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,""  Kline said.      The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,  evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories  from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat  content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,  moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.  "

gnp,"PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES  Pakistan says its economy has continued  its recent outstanding performance during the financial year  1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,  investments and energy were causing concern.      GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980  and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according  to a government economic survey.       The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum  and there was an impressive performance in a five point  government program for rural uplift, education and poverty  alleviation, said the survey.      Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news  conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms  damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct  compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now  slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.      The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine  pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.      Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from  2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home  remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs  from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.      More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments  situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in  home remittances, he said.      The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to  2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of  the boost in exports.      He said national investment continued to be small because  of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more  savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the  present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh  five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.  "

gnp,"KENYAN MINISTER FORECASTS ECONOMIC EXPANSION  Kenya's economy will continue to expand  this year and the government will do more to encourage  investment by foreign firms and the local private sector,  Planning Minister Robert Ouko said.      He told a news conference that the government would soon  create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment  applications by local and foreign investors.      Praising the role of multinational companies and local  entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to  maintain a close working contact with the private sector.      The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in  1985, Ouko said.      This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee  exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes,  he added.      ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices,  Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the  planning minister said.      ""High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade  liberalisation and disciplined financial management are  expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,"" he  said.      Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable  weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises  announced in February, the minister added.      Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the  long rainy season, which is due to start about now.      Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops  increased during the second half of last year.      Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya  rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period,  he said.      Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its  contribution to the economy and promised to improve government  cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact  with them.      ""I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its  contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to  maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector  grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same  period the previous year,"" he said.      Ouko said the ""one stop"" bureau was intended to stimulate  investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved  in processing applications.      The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan  economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation  falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier.      This was owing to higher agricultural production and the  Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major  currencies, the report said.      The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr  last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half  yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in  July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during  the period.      This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of  780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period,  compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in  the second half of 1985, it said.  "
nat-gas,"NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE  Higher crude oil prices will raise  demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost  to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.      The analysts said that these efforts will be most  successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large  and growing energy requirements.      ""Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of  oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual  fuel industry last year,"" Michael Smolinski, an energy  economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.      An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went  into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last  year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.       Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national  average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected  2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive,  Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American  Gas Association said.      The average delivered prices at the end of January were  2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.      ""We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic  feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and  third quarter (1987),"" he said.      In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be  an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas,  Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp.  in New York noted.      Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North  American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and  less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this  spring freeing gas for spot sales.      These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears  that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices  significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last  year.      AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline,  much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production  quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which  permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.      Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus  was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986  to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not  go away until 1990.      Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would  persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain  consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast  U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.  "

The SOMC, a group of basically ""monetarist"" private  economists, said that ""economic growth will accelerate in 1987  in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal  Reserve.""      The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As a  result, it said that ""inflation and ultimately another  recession now loom on the horizon.""      The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on  progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead  to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.      The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or  inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the  Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was  basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a  member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.      Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage  point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer  prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.      The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been  a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly  inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to ""abandon  its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary  base on the path toward sustained lower inflation.""      The Fed in February said it would no longer target the  narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and  economic growth has been largely severed.    "

gnp,"GERMAN BANKS SAY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ECONOMY GROWING  Uncertainty is growing about the prospects  for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale  back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro  Association said.      Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while  industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said  in a report.      However, last month's agreement among the six leading  western industrialized countries to keep currencies around  present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for  exporters, it added.      The banking association said the possibility of using  monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be  overestimated.      Another small drop in already low interest rates could not  be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of  consumer or capital goods, it said.      The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and  Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for  any further monetary moves, the association added.      On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross  national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar  adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the  third quarter.      The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP  in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively  weak.

The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987  is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.      Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.      He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due  to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct  real drop in the contribution of the external sector.      The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a  drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative  component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.  "
livestock,"CUBAN CATTLE THREATENED BY DROUGHT  Over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering  the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a  prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle  producing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.      The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the  island's number two province in milk production. Granma said  20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.      The newspaper said a ""cattle emergency"" had been decreed and  the cattle are being rounded up.      Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane  conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned  before being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the  residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have  been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.      Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef  rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana,  each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every  18 days.      In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no  rain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands are  parched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of  silage projected in its annual plan.      Granma said rainfall over the past year has been less than  50 pct of normal precipitation.  "

In its World Production and Trade Report, the department  said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for  bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to  identify Mexican steers.

gnp,"FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES  France's right wing government is facing  growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising  down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation  forecasts for this year.      Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector  forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation  estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its  economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a  2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last  september.      Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures  would not push the government off its chosen mix of price  deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.      But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would  push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising  the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.      And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed  Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth  and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,  perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential  elections due by April 1988.      ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,""  said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the  impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth  this year.""      ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage  moderation will be maintained,"" he added.      The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout  1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises  justified by increased productivity.      But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond  Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already  rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built  into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher  prices.      Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he  also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He  announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the  government would spend two billion francs on a series of  measures to boost employment and training      Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate  Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac  earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of  France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings  its top priority.      But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and  still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts  said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.      ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist  government and I dont think this administration is going to  reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at  recently-privatised Banque Paribas.      Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas  and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher  inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he  said.      Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more  than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7  per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.      ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement  considering that for the first time since the Second World War  all french prices have been freed,"" he commented.      Finance Ministry officials said that the governments  abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible  for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living  costs.      But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should  have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.      Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long  as the government kept wages under control.      Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of  1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more  than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,  INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,  he added.      Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to  help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget  deficit, several analysts said.      So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value  Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a  loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than  expected growth, they said.  "
livestock,"JAPAN BEEF PRICE SUPPORT CUT WILL NOT RAISE DEMAND  Japan's plan to cut beef intervention  prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost  demand because of strict supply controls and a complex  distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.      ""Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting  consumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,"" a  Housewives Association of Japan official said.      Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm  markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which  maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.      Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the  standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled  beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against  1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.      The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from  dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling  at 1,325 against 1,420.      Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock  Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations  to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention  price zone.      The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount  set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale  prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,  both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when  prices are below.      But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef  stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.      Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export  Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step  toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about  half those in Japan.      But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.  Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated  distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.      The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices  are high mainly because of distribution problems and high  production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.      American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.  Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan  Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in  the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand  will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp  reduction in intervention prices.      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he  will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he  visits here next month.      In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by  9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.      In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from  168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants  to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.  "

But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a  slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last  year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing  economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.      The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,  but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.      The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five  pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in  import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour  costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report  said.      This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand  should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption  made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.      Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in  Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and  adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in  a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.  "
nat-gas,"BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE  Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of  Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.      Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the  United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,  analysts said.      Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South  closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has  relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.       In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs  per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas  costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.      Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.      Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.      Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a  Brooklyn Union official said.      Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said  most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through  to rate payers.      While net effect on the company will not be known for  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,  will end up paying more for gas, he said.      Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be  small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette, said.      If the situation persists into winter heating season, high  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.      Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for  spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,  Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost  factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with  end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering  firm, said.      ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of the  take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said.      Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.      Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to  alternative fuels, he said.      In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being  negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.      Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory  on the inventory charge, he said.      ""Cool heads will prevail,"" DLJ's Launer said, "" but it may  take a while.""  "

gnp,"DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987  Leaks of a major Dutch official  economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate  reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this  year, political and market sources say.      Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness  this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage  increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some  calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.      But whatever the government's response, the central bank  will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.      The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)  publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will  also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and  the economy.      Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate  reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch  economic growth was now seen around one pct.      Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the  decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West  Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,  Pierson said in its February economic outlook.      The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct  growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of  2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.      The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the  government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of  reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.      Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central  bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if  necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.      Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised  the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in  last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and  expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.      But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy  had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the  dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.      Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not  to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead  lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.      Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move  saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on  the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the  moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already  far below the market rates.""      Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of  the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest  rate policies serve that goal.      Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands  recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold  to take profits.      Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would  reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more  dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch  interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued  completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.      Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision  not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson  warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.      Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry  and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having  said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower  Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.      One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down  to reduce the government debt burden.      A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were  needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between  the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is  steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said.  "
gold,"PRECIOUS METALS CLIMATE IMPROVING, SAYS MONTAGU  The climate for precious metals is  improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears  and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets,  brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.      Silver prices in March gained some 15 pct in dlr terms due  to a weak dollar and silver is felt to be fairly cheap relative  to gold, Montagu said in its monthly silver newsletter. In  March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67.      The supply/demand position has improved in the past year,  and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is  modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added.      The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to  continue in the short term.      A period of consolidation might be necessary before prices  attempted to move significantly higher,it said, but so long as  the dollar remains under pressure then the outlook for silver  was positive.      However silver was less likely to continue to outpace the  other metals by such a margin, Montagu said.  "

This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight  fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it  said.      The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out  some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in  inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.      The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product  growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986  and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after  last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.      But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest  increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate  unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial  nation OECD area.      Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to  the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,  the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct  rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct  respectively in 1986.      The faster growth of imports compared with exports this  year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant  that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP  would shrink in both years.      But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there  should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than  GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to  improving international balances,"" the OECD said.      Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually  buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several  years of relative weakness, it noted.      In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat  to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall  GDP, it added.      The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained  bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels  last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation  in both the industry and service sectors, it said.      As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment  investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year  after vigorous growth in 1986.      But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for  tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector  earners of foreign exchange.      The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the  accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could  lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.      Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in  international financial markets give rise to the question  whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial  flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed  required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said.  "

gnp,"GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY  Four of West Germany's five leading  economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary  growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.      But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,  echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said  the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not  necessarily threaten stability.      The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which  three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in  GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.      The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in  view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has  shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price  rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.      Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may  seem exaggerated, they said.      ""But it has often turned out in the past that the price  climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into  a restrictive policy,"" they said.      The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are  less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.      The four institutes disputed the view that monetary  expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic  investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market  investments following lower interest rates.      ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of  central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a  smaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.      A return to growth and stability did not require  spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with  open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid  an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.      The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be  focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of  uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic  weakness other factors should be taken into account.      Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts  and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation  speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat  in itself to price stability.      The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth  reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the  falling mark.  "

gnp,"FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH  French gross domestic product will grow  by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the  government's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private  Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le  Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.      However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986  level of two pct.      IPECODE said demand and production would develop in  parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production  was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic  demand, unleashing higher import demand.      Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298  mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in  francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of  Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of  French debts.      Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund  (FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.      French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last  year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct  in 1988, it added.      Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this  year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.      Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,  is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE  said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.      However, the institute said inflation would fall back to  2.5 pct at the end of 1988, ""provided that real wage costs  remain within the framework of productivity rises.""  "
gold,"GERMAN ANALYSTS SEE GOLD RISING IN 2ND HALF 1987  The price of gold bullion is likely  to rise in the second half of the year on increased private  investor demand, West German analysts said.      Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this  year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank  Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the  U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.      ""A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock  exchanges,"" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for  further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.      Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.      Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many  investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.      Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock  exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.      Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's  foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is  poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half  of this year.      The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an  ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and  430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.  "

livestock,"EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE  U.S. officials said they held out  little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a  controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into  effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut  off their exports.      But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.  plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year  provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.  Agriculture Department.      The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will  require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC  inspection standards beginning April 30.      The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting  the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.      At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln  dlrs in 1985.      The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes  in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing  to use of wood.      Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,  one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved  without further review. USDA would have to certify that the  plants had corrected the deficiencies.      All remaining plants with a history or potential of  shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more  significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before  further EC review.      Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat  Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal  trade retaliation petition by April 30.      An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft  petition.      An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said  U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,  but that ""the chances of that are not too good at this time.""      However, there is the ""expectation"" in U.S. government and  meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow  shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from  U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring  their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the  USTR official said.

gnp,"VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT DEFENDS REFINANCING ACCORD  president jaime lusinchi defended the  20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government  recently signed, saying it will open new credit flows and bring  needed foreign investment to venezuela.      In his annual state of the nation speech, lusinchi also  said venezuela supports other latin american debtors, despite  having reached a rescheduling accord on its own.      In the 90-minute speech to the congress, lusinchi summed up  the achievements of his administration, which took office in  february 1984. He pointed to the 3.3 pct growth in non-oil gdp  in 1986 and to a ""moderate"" 12 pct inflation rate.      Lusinchi said the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed  feb. 27 put an end to a process which had been 'the calvary of  our nation over the post four years.'      In the refinancing accord, he said, venezuela managed to  achieve 'the most inmportant thing, which is the reopening of  financial flows from abroad, essential for the financing of  development and the (financing) of trade and investment.'      Once all the details of the agreement are finalized, he  said, venezuela will seek new financing for the imported  components of new development projects.      ""our intention is not to continue being net exporters of  capital, but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of  capital towards venezuela,"" he said.      Under the agreement signed february 27, venezuela extended  payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years, while the interest  rate was lowered from 1 y 1/8 to 7/8 of a pct over libor.      At the same time, payments over the next three years were  lowered from 3.450 to 1.350 billion dlrs.      Lusinchi defended the rescheduling accord against critics  who said it merely deferred the weight of payments to future  governments.  "
gnp,"PORTUGAL'S GDP FORECAST TO GROW FOUR PCT THIS YEAR  Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986,  according to a Bank of Portugal forecast.      Total investment this year, the country's second as a  member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct,  again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said.      It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to  show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13  billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year.      Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and  raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar.      Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year  and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and  6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said.      The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the  non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current  government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending  and income and in wage policy.      The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on  the assumption that the international economic situation and  Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the  same as in 1986.      The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated  for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing  optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved  since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year,  especially in the construction and public works sectors.      Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost  investment last year, the bank said.  "
nat-gas,"U.S. COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION  A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that  oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the  Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to  eight major oil companies.      The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies  and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing  program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that  challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.      The administration said that the court-ordered halt in  drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid  for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.      A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt  all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in  the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the  subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.      But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in  issuing an injunction halting exploration.      ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was  not at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court.  ""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact  that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs  to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which  they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration  been enjoined,"" he said.      The oil companies, Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp &lt;XON>,  Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Union Oil,  had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in  staggering financial losses.      The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and  generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984  covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.      Administration officials, saying the lease sales were  preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that  the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.      The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an  organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that  the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.  "

""Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300  metres within the Baong formation,"" he said.

gnp,"NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER  Bundesbank vice president Helmut  Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.      With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in  May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,  Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a  further cut in interest rates was needed.      The economy is picking up, after contracting by a  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from  the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting  in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.      Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been  pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.      Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in  1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole  would probably be between one and two pct.     ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic  demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six  pct target.      He said the target could still be achieved but much will  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.      ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit  reversed,"" Schlesinger said.      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction  that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have  diminished,"" Schlesinger said.      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.      ""Central banks are always in contact about these  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""  Schelsinger said.      ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,  adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American  case.""      He said that the West German export industry has been hit  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see  some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term  fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""      ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level  (of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West  German inflation down year.      Although there have recently been signs of inflation  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.      But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away  from it.""  "

It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from  representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial  feasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate.      Houston Metals said gold, silver and the base metals have  recoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct, with 95 pct of gold recovered  from better gold ores, while gallium, germanium and indium have  recoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in the  zinc concentrate.      The company's 1987 program of diamond drilling, underground  drifting and metallurgical evaluation is scheduled to start on  April.

This  contrasts with a rise of more than nine pct in 1985.      The main reason for the slower rate of economic growth was  a drop in the real value of agricultural output. This declined  12 pct in 1986 following a 24 pct improvement the previous  year. Mining output fell one pct in 1986 but manufacturing  production increased 1.4 pct.      The CSO said that at current prices GDP rose 12.7 pct to  8.2 billion Zimbabwe dlrs, but inflation, measured by the GDP  deflator, was estimated at 12.2 pct, so there was virtually no  growth in real output during 1986.

This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the  semi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) last  December.      Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky,  told Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting  attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina,  National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative.

nat-gas,"USX &lt;X> PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986  USX Corp said proved reserves of oil  and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the  end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.      The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,  indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7  mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last  June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.      USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,  had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil  and gas operations.      About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit  and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield  services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.      According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell  slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign  reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large  drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,  where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,  reflecting the exclusion of Libya.      Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet  at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.      Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and  Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic  feet, excluding Libyan reserves.      U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet  from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion  from 1.53 trillion.      In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962  mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986  audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited  figure the company reported on Jan 27.      USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs  in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment  tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the  other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.      In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were  shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be  permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03  billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge  included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in  Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.      Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,  Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.      ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved  market conditions for the products from these plants may make  it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report.      ""On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement  may necessitate their permanent closing,"" it added.  "

gnp,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists  say.      Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.      Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.      This was after taking into account inflation in consumer  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.      Factors depressing economic activity include the  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.      But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive  new debt settlement program was introduced.      The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.      The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.      Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are  still owed by individuals and companies.      There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as  bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it  will not allow any banks to go under.      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether  debtors have regular cash flows or not.      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector  is the biggest after oil.      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as  crude.      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will  remain steady.      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit  Gulf.      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these  reserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit for  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some  shortfall.      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for  economic growth this year or next.      ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer is  important.""      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the  economy.      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.  "
nat-gas,"COASTAL &lt;CGP> SEEKS TO HALT BILLION DLR LAWSUIT  Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy  court will hear its request today for a restraining order to  stop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by &lt;TransAmerican  Natural Gas Corp>.      TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy  proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit  to block Coastal from taking control.      Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which  is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its  own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.      Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves  and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an  undisclosed amount.      TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values  its total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about  one billion dlrs.      The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in  Texas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and  over 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.      About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot  market sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.      Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay  its 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. The  lawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one  billion in punitive damages from Coastal.      Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market  since 1979, when it was forced to sell &lt;Lo-Vaca Gas Gathering  Co> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas  customers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.      Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,  earned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, about  half the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices.  "

livestock,"U.S. HOUSE PANEL EXTENDS EEP, URGES USSR OFFER  The U.S. House Agriculture Committee  approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement  Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan  administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union.      The proposals were approved as amendments to a  comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year.      In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee  approved several proposals which could restrict imports of  lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those  amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because  the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall  jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them,  Congressional sources said.      The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the  life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than  the current three years through fiscal 1988.      The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also  would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from  1.5 billion now.      Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by  Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department  to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition  value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct  less expensive to operate.      The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by  Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration  make an offer, but urges such action.      The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn  English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to  begin discussions with other major grain producing countries  aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.      Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the  amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work.      Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved  by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on  imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm  product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered  by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at  curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and  foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect  peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said.      Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of  casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New  Zealand and Ireland.      The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same  countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.  beef imports.      Other miscellaneous amendments included:      -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against  Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove  restrictions on beef imports.      -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped  each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to  800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now.      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of  the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to  determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.      -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the  National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the  costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a  Canadian countervailing duty case this year.      -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision  to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the  European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.      -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National  Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a  reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus.

nat-gas,"U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH  The U.S. oil and gas industry is in  better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony  given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of  the industry hearing today.       The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas  industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company  executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry  downturn had bottomed out.       ""The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal  more optimistic (than last year),"" Commissioner James E. (Jim)  Nugent told Reuters.       ""It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are  seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,"" he added, ""and with  just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move  again.""       The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil  prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to  as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to  around 18 dlrs a barrel.       At the same time, a number of company executives testified  that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment  was still hurting and in need of government help.       Production costs are considerably higher in the United  States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell  many domestic producers were forced to shut down their  operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs  operating in the United States compared with an average of  nearly 2,000 in 1985.       Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of  Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil  coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing  dependency on imports, particularly from the politically  volatile Middle East.       ""In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower  prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day  (bpd),"" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply  Department at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation's largest oil  company.       At the same time, Simon said ""U.S. oil production declined  by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,"" and ""net  petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.""       Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain  between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to  control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at  1986 levels, leading to ""a significant amount of spare  worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.""       He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued  volatility and called for ""governmental and regulatory policies  in support of the domestic petroleum industry.""       Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal  government through the 1986 tax code changes and ""Superfund""  legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall  profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access  to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.       Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the  industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's  domestic operations before imports reach such a level that  national security might be compromised.       In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports  could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that  Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the  free world's total oil consumption by that date.       Arguing that ""oil is a political tool in every nation on  earth,"" Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today called  for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, ""before  the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and  our national security is compromised.""       Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,  agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that  were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a  ""shambles.""       Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.  ""For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is  over,"" he said.       Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining  and Marketing Co, said he was ""enthusiastic about the future,""  adding that he expected ""an increase in profitability by  midyear.""  "

gnp,"INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY  The five leading West German economic  research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the  domestic economy will expand this year but revised down  forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.      The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen  predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross  national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared  with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast  three pct 1987 growth in October last year.      Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin  and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.      The joint report said that the estimates of economic  development made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly less  favourable"" than those of the other three.      The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a  slow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,  however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.      The two institutes said external economic factors which  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would  dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no  marked improvement in the course of the year.      The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline in  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""      They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.  But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled  but only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""      They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuation  of the economic uptrend are still favourable.""      These three institutes said diminishing external burdens  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in  demand and production could be expected by the spring.      However, this projection was clouded by risks including the  further development of the mark against the dollar.      Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the  economy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exports  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during  the course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.      The three more positive institutes saw private consumption  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,  while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.      They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in  1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.      All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in  unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in  work of about 200,000.      These three institutes said new jobs would be created  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in  the context of job creation measures. The construction industry  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.      The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only  in the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in the  manufacturing industry will decline.""      The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.      They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.      The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.  "
gold,"LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS  The elimination of limits on daily price  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the  Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect  on the market, analysts said.      ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.      ""The market has not approached the old price limits and  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said.      On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver  futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting  of all daily limits, effective today.      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.      Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby  contracts amid quiet trading today.      During the last week of April, silver futures often traded  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the  dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.      As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.      The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic  buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.      O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would  add caution to trading.      ""This is a more realistic approach because the metals  market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""  O'Neill said.  "

It gave no figures.      It said the province, China's second largest gold producer  after Shandong, plans to double gold output by 1990 from the  1986 level. China does not publish gold production figures.      However, industry sources estimate output at about 65  tonnes a year, with exports put between 11 and 31 tonnes.

nat-gas,"BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE  Britoil Plc's &lt;BTOL.L> exploration  expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a  third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would  remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker  said.      He told reporters following the release of the company's  1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986  levels.      U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from  184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from  156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in  1985.      Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to  134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary  charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results  were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share  firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir  Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986  had made the period extremely difficult but the company had  come through remarkably well.      Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the  conditions would be right for a substantially improved  performance this year.      He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when  they were normally weaker, made him ""a bit encouraged"" about the  prospects for future levels.      Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price  stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.      Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement  of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the  latter part of April.      End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared  with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this  included a revised definition of reserves.      If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the  reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels  previously.      Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a  restated 3,660 billion.  "
gnp,"JAPAN ECONOMY MAY BE NEAR BOTTOM, ECONOMISTS SAY  The worst may be just about over for  Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect  a vigorous recovery anytime soon. Japanese bank economists  polled by Reuters said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is  likely to end in the first half of this year, helped by rising  exports, stepped-up government spending and falling prices. ""The  economy will bottom out in the middle of the year,"" said  Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist, Masahiko Koido.      Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu  Taketomi agreed. ""It (the bottom) is in the offing,"" he said.      But he added that the recovery will be slow. Growth in the  fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 2.2 pct,  from two pct in the current year, he said.      Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst  are increasing.      The volume of exports in the first two months of the year  rose slightly on a year-on-year basis, after declining toward  the end of last year.      Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a  sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks,  several economists said it could mark the beginning of a  recovery.      Industrial production fell 0.7 pct in January, much smaller  than expected, and is forecast by the government to rise 0.3  pct in February and 2.6 pct in March. A Bank of Japan survey  released last week showed that the decline in Japanese  corporate earnings may be nearing its end.      And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes  the rapid yen rise has come to the end, they said.      Six nations - the U.K., Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And  West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise  currencies around current levels.      The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two  years has hit the export-driven economy hard, by forcing its  companies to raise prices and lose sales in the U.S. Market.      ""The important thing is the exchange rate,"" Taketomi said.      If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise  investment in plant and equipment, although there are no signs  of that yet, economists said.      A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their  competitive edge just as the U.S economy may be starting to  recover, economists said.      Domestically, the economy may get a boost from some  loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo  Muto, manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.      The next reading of the economy's health should come early  next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter,  1986.      Most private economists expect a rise of about 0.5 pct from  the previous quarter. In the third quarter, GNP rose 0.6 pct.      But a senior government official said the fourth quarter  figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point  quarter-on-quarter. But he added that would be a statistical  aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity.      To maintain year-on-year growth of around 2.5 pct, the  economy would have had to rise about 1.2 pct in the fourth  quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong.       The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a  statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of  1986, the official said.      Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also  distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second  half of 1986.      Because the coins were classified as legal tender, their  purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer  expenditure. Consumer spending also tailed off in December  because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year  bonuses, they said.      As the government had to buy back some of the coins from  retailers because they were unsold, the government's  contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been  boosted, economists said.      Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from  government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last  year was good.      The senior government official said the fourth quarter  performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than  generally expected, while that of the external sector was  better.  "
gold,"MORGAN BANK PLANS WARRANTS FOR GOLD AT 425 DLRS  Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York  plans an issue of 12,000 warrants for gold bullion at 425 dlrs  an ounce, lead manager Morgan Guaranty (Switzerland) AG said.      Each warrant, priced at 955 Swiss francs, entitled holders  to acquire five-ounce bars of .999 gold in the period from  April 30, 1987, to July 31, 1991, exercisable on Wednesdays.      The warrants represented unsecured, unsubordinated  liabilities of the borrower. Payment was due April 16, and a  quotation on the Luxembourg bourse was planned.      The warrants, when exercised, would be repaid in current  dollars based on the value of gold on the exercise date.      The conditions represent a premium of about 145 dlrs an  ounce to the current gold price.      A Morgan (Switzerland) official said that on the basis of  the maturity of four years and three months, the pricing  involved an implicit volatility of gold of 24.5 pct before the  warrants were in the money, compared with implicit volatility  of 30 pct for the Indosuez gold warrants and 26 pct for the  Citibank gold warrants recent issued with maturities of 18 and  24 months.

The company also said its natural gas revenues so far this  year have been reduced by lower contract customer purchases due  to mild weather and soft economic conditions.      ""But the contracts call for the lower 'takes' to be made up  during the course of the year,"" Mitchell Energy said. Meanwhile  it will sell additional quantities of gas on the spot market.      Mitchell Energy said the additional spot sales will tend to  lower the average price realized for gas in the early part of  fiscal 1988.      However, it said the average for the full year is not  expected to be significantly lower than the 2.99 dlrs per  thousand cubic feet averaged in fiscal 1987.                     "
livestock,"EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE  The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of  social and structural measures agreed early today by European  Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers  for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission  sources said.      The ministers agreed that under this ""extensification""  scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut  output of specific products by at least 20 pct.      The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and  wine, they added.      Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by  reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their  number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,  farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity  for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.      The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but  will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on  the production they forego.      The sources said the package also contains provisions for  payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting  or improving the environment.      It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured  farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such  allowances are available only for livestock.      The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into  alternative farming techniques, the sources added.      At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen  said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the  EC and member states to provide direct income supports for  relatively poor farmers.      Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state  aid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion of  competition.""      EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a  difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus  production.      The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night  proposals to pay ""early retirement"" pensions to farmers aged 55  or over who gave up production. Those who took their land  completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to  their heirs, would have received more generous payments.      Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised  proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme  agreed.  "
livestock,"JAPAN SEEN REDUCING BEEF, PORK INTERVENTION PRICES  The Agriculture Ministry is expected to  reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in  1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been  set yet, industry sources said.      Production prices, the basis for setting intervention  prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed  prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said.      Last November an advisory panel urged the government to  work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to  levels closer to international values, the sources added.      In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation  zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers.      The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government  Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock  operation in the wholesale market.      The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be  set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the  Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on  March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or  bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is  1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said.      The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from  dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is  1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540  yen per kilo and the ceiling 760.      They said the domestic beef intervention price influences  imported beef selling prices on the domestic market.      Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government  body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or  processors in line with the standard price of other beef  categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef  prices, they said.

gnp,"BANKS SEE GERMAN GROWTH OF AT LEAST TWO PCT  External risks for the economy have  increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still  possible, according to President of the West German Federation  of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.      Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further  fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the  revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West  German exporters were facing a ""rough wind.""      However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private  consumption in particular would support the economy, he said.  He saw good prospects for consumer industries.      Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to  concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this  context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase  the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.      He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled  for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this  month, was an ""important step in the right direction.""      The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from  56 pct.

livestock,"U.S. IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS  New immigration rules relating to  alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S.  Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress,  sources on Capitol Hill said.      USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that  would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the  cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable  commodities.      The department is considering including in its definition  of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,  Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,  the New York Times reported yesterday.      Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the  definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which  is ""a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,""  Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.      Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying  USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty  provision, farm industry sources said.      Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said  livestock producers were ""desperate"" because they fear they will  be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined  that industry.      A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986  immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress  did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers  who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and  Spanish reeds was ""marginal.""      In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration  of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the  the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees  ""a tough call,"" this source said.      USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation  except to say it was subject to change before it will be  released, probably some time later this month.      While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under  consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is  not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration  question, congressional sources said.      The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers  was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.      Congressional staff members estimate the special farm  worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to  350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who  worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply  for temporary, then permanent, resident status.  "

gnp,"BOLIVIA TO OFFER TO BUY BACK BANK DEBT  Bolivia is to make a formal offer during  the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from  commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank  president Jier Nogales said.       Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering  committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider  the offer at a meeting in New York last month.       He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian  paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now  trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value.      Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back  its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the  discounted rate in full.      Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to  30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the  international markets, he added.      Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans  to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there  would be no money available to restart traditional debt  servicing to them for some time.       Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to  cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs,  but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a  formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at  discounted rates.      Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would  determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in  the next few months.       He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over  the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make  a single non-negotiable offer.      He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly  creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only  traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would  mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss  provisions, he added.      ""We are confident that the banks are going to be  reasonable,"" Nogales said. ""Now they can resolve their problems  for once and for all.""      ""The most conservative ones who want a little more will  wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will  be open all the time,"" he added.      Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four  billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to  governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales  said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent  discussions with the Paris Club.       He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule  Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while  accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest  rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris  Club rules, he added.       He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard  penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with  Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt.      He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from  international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400  mln dlrs in disbursements this year.      The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed  from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow  of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added.      Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now  stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in  disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro  took office in August, 1985.      Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a  year in the government's first month in office, was now down to  10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the  plan was that it should continue at this level.      He said the government was also expecting at least three  pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative  rates.  "
gnp,"U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH  The U.S. economy is showing some  promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the  sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private  economists say.      Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December  period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter  this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in  January slowed business and consumer spending.      But some of the latest economic data show signs of  surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some  economists remain cautious about the outlook.      The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for  durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct  rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense  goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency  said.      The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many  financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to  increases of up to five pct.      The January/February employment statistics suggest the  Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for  the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an  economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.      The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,  the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm  jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in  January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.      The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of  about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.      Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding  their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the  second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the  second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption  and government spending. He also sees residential construction  declining mostly for multi-family housing units.      Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the  fourth quarter slowness will continue.      Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the  first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and  show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.      The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the  U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in  the dollar's value over the last year and half.      ""The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,"" Levy  predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at  least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the  prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.      The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,  which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year  and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the  year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.      As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.  has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their  domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.      U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the  pressure off the United States whose five years of economic  growth has been the mainstay of developing countries.      The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for  their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to  service their foreign debt.      The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a  modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.      There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance  between the volume of goods imported to the United States and  those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of  exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact  that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened  during the closing three months of 1986.      While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate  profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the  government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured  by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a  moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.      The government also reported that consumer spending, a key  element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in  February, after falling two pct in January.      The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the  manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements  of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.      In its latest report on current economic conditions, the  Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the  country ranged from uneven or steady to improving.  Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most  regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.      Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the  pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the  drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major  pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy  will slip into recession either.      He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts  that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze  consumers purchasing power.      ""That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of  years,"" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around  a modest two pct level for the next few years.  "
gnp,"FRENCH ECONOMIC COUNCIL PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH  France's Economic and Social Council  (CES), an advisory body comprising industrialists, trade  unionists and representatives of other sectors of the French  economy, said the country's annual growth may not reach two pct  in 1987.      French gross domestic product risks not reaching the two  pct growth registered last year, the Council said in a report  on first quarter 1987 economic activity without giving any  specific forecasts. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur was  quoted today as saying that French 1987 growth will probably be  about two pct.      Balladur said in an interview with the financial daily Les  Echos that the country's economic growth will probably be about  the same as last year due to a less favourable international  environment.      CES President Philippe Neeser said one of the major fears  for the French economy this year was a resurge in inflation.      Disinflation was an absolute priority, Neeser told  journalists, adding that a failure to do this would be  extremely serious as if would be very difficult to reverse for  many years.  "

Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of  408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and  New York's close of 410.00/50.      Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some  initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet  this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities,  they added.      However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish  impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60  dlrs, dealers said.      On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of  3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778  close.  "
gold,"FORMER GOLD FIRM EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN JAPAN  The public prosecutors and police  here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold  deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of  about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered,  police said.      The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted  when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death  here in public view in June, 1985.      Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's  home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later  emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.      The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold  gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide  business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees  at its peak in early 1985.      Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200  billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners  and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985,  according to lawyers.      Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back  neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150  billion yen, local press reports said.      Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today  included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president,  and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list.      They were suspected of having collaborated with the late  Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people  in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before  the firm's bankruptcy, they said.      Today's arrest came after narly two years of joint  investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who had  questioned about 3,000 of the firm's former employees,  police sources said.  "

In its newly-released annual report to shareholders,  Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which  was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be  upheld if appealed again.      ""To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful  settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any  realistic effort to settle the matter,"" Pennzoil chairman Hugh  Liedtke said in the annual report.      Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital  spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.      Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to  964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet  in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program,  Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln  barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.       The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339  mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17  pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by  60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.      U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to  an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per  day in 1985.      The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln  dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income  in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.      Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of  its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to  maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont  Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of  Mexico's Mobile Bay area.      ""Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest  Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,"" the  company said. ""Pennzoil's share of this production initially  should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of  15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.""      In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled  2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The  average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton  from 141.05 dlrs in 1985.      ""The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains  bright,"" the company said. ""We expect sulphur's pricing  structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in  the third and fourth quarters.""  "

gnp,"TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986  Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments  deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking  steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali  Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning  Organisation said.      He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of  economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,  which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.      Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a  drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury  wholesale index last year.      This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the  economic management will have to be careful,"" he said.      Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme  which is central to the government's economic planning, said  Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account  shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.      ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to  sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure  over the last five years,"" he added.      His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said  Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms  would look better if inflation were lower and the current  account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.      ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector  investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a  percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible  improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said.      Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was  also to blame for the high deficits.      Appropriations to government departments had been cut by  eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign  borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.      ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the  investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he  said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing  requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated  5.6 pct in 1986.      More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also  targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage  exports, and production incentives were being considered.      ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected  into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion  policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and  local private capital come more into play as far as  manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said.      He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish  economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under  way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate  policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done  in a country where the state still dominates industry and the  currency is only partially convertible.

Next years APC, held in Atlanta, will be a business session  only and will continue to be the first week of March.

In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded in  early 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deterioration  in competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seen  at risk from accelerating wages.      The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come under  pressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well as  Norway, Sweden and Finland.      Overall economic growth will vary in the different  countries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual report  said.      After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domestic  demand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and one  pct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see a  slump in domestic demand. The report said growth in Gross  Domestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly in  Sweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmark  and Norway.      Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economic  strategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustained  and balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.  "

In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous  quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter.      The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based  1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against  113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of  1985.      The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a  whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985.      On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised  seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to  114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter,  giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO  figures show.      On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose  by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the  year-ago quarter.      The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively.      Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of  1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same  1985 quarter.      The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in  the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.      The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with  the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9  against 109.4 a year earlier.      For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct against  against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose  2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985.      The government usually considers the output measure the  most reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes.      It is based on output data for production industry and  partial information for the rest of the economy.      The government had forecast that average measure GDP would  rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget  unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct.      The GDP deflator, based on expenditure at market prices,  rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter from the third, to give a  2.4 pct rise over fourth quarter 1985.

The company said the study found proven ore reserves of  3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It  said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per  year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three  years for a rapid payback of capital costs.      The company said the feasibility study calls for gold  production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the  mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with  99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune  life.      Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment  and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said.   It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the  associated mill by Geodome.      Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not  included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine  holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of  gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are  reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be  milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility  study used a 350 dlr gold price.

The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the  largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry  and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in  the country, they said.

livestock,"DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY  Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European  Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this  year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth  disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.      The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the  EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC  veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.      The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has  already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to  bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy  industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export  revenue.      ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally  when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of  beef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.       Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on the  seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then  decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting  beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension  on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are  still awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to be  identified.      Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of  high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had  spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and  upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.      Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be  forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low  prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales  could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.  "
nat-gas,"FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED  The Reagan administration wants to  encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not  believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment,  Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.      ""It seems to me that more trade between us is better than  less trade,"" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.      To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign  policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the  Soviet Union to lapse, he said.      Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining  export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited  items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.

gold,"GERMAN BANK SEES HIGHER GOLD PRICE FOR 1987  Gold is expected to continue its rise  this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in  the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.      It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil  prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'  efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to  growing inflationary pressures in the U.S.      Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed  central bank limits and real growth of their gross national  products, it added.      Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased  industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank  said.      Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on  futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.      These factors and South Africa's unstable political  situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold  supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it  said.      However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90  tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.  "

The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest  hit by currency appreciation this year.      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes  increasingly ragged.      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last  year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at  1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate  is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an  average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper  angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball  rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter  U.S. Fsical policy,"" it said.      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding  that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar  would collapse.      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt  crisis, it said.      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look  ""increasingly sick.""      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in  December, the EIU said.      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more  competitively-priced dollar.      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.  "
gnp,"GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT  The outlook for the West  German economy is relatively bright, with gross national  product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel  University's Institute for World Economy said.      The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading  economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic  than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently  reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.      In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export  outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's  strength against the dollar and other major currencies.      ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in  all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise  in exports can be expected.""      The institute said past experience has shown West German  exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by  cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting  their product ranges.      They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in  economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the  decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow  this year.      West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed  advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both  of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary  policy, the institute said.      However, it said the labour market would see only a slight  improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire  additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by  agreed reductions in working hours.      The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of  monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked  acceleration of inflation.      It also warned that what it called the worldwide  synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new  global recession. It said central banks in industrialized  countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal  Reserve Board's expansionary course.      The institute said this in turn was bound to lead  eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.  Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks  were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could  aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as  increase protectionism around the world.      Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the  negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary  policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of  growth at home.      The institute said this could be done by ensuring that  fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes  should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and  wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than  in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary  pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply  to about four pct.  "

gnp,"JAPANESE GROUPS URGE DRASTIC ECONOMIC PACKAGE  Japan's leading economic organisations  urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures  even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's  planned tax reforms, officials involved said.      Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations  (Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the  Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency  measure to prop up the economy.      Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in  the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should  also be used to stimulate the economy.      Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall  below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies  that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy.      The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for  drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the  Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.      Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan  intervention to stabilise exchange rates.      Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the  awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up  Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct.      Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present  critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop  the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.      The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of  Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program.  "

The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an  additional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,  contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier, the  company said.      The original concession appears to have a substantial  amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or  6/100 ounces, of gold per metric ton.      But the venture has no firm estimates on the costs of  extracting the gold and no assurances can be given that the  reserves can be mined profitably, the company said.      It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted tests on the  newly granted land but added the land seems to be similar in  geological characteristics to the original land.  "
gnp,"U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel  Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,  said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar  1987.      He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of  payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1  billion shortfall in 1986.      Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this  year, Lawson said.      ""As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may  continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by  the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the  year,"" he added.      Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),  Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0  billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.      The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.      On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for  the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal  1987/88.      No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3  aggregate, he said. ""But broad money will continue to be taken  into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course  will the exchange rate,"" the Chancellor told Parliament.      Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 ""is  chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax  revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an  increasingly profitable business sector in particular.""      On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier  assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per  barrel in calendar 1987.      He said ""it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax  revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the  economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the  public finances in a very strong position.""      Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at  1.0 pct of GDP in future.      ""We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term  Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0  pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years  ahead,"" Lawson said.      ""Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this  year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course  remains a major objective of government policy.""      ""But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence  and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.""      Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange  Control Act from the Statute book.      On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged  at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be  charged at the ""appropriate corporation tax rate.""      He said that under the new proposed system, companies  should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments  against tax on capital gains.      ""Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in  1988/89,"" Lawson said.      Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building  societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation  tax, ""with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after  the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.""      ""I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new  method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and  File.""      This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax  collection, and would not come into force until the early  1990s.      Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax  (PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct  of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their  (PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those  new fields exceeds the costs incurred.      Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending  on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any  particular field.      On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive  tax relief for retraining workers.      Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value  Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax  on the basis of cash paid and received.      Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of  quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being  extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds  are to be raised to 21,300 stg.      New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.      The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be  set at 125,000 stg.      Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies  in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be  able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.  The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but ""genuine  trading companies"" will not be affected.      He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit  relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank  loans, also from April 1.      ""In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit  only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,"" he said.      The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two  pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.      Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic  taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added ""given my decision  to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to  reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.""      Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to  27 pct, he said.      On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to  change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it  into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities  made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable  provisions made by financial traders.      The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with  Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.      ""The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the  Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,"" Lawson  said.   MORE  "

gold,"GERMAN BANK SEES HIGHER GOLD PRICE FOR 1987  Gold is expected to continue its rise  this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in  the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.      It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil  prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'  efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growing  inflationary pressures in the U.S., The world's biggest crude  oil producer.      Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed  the central banks' limits and real growth of their gross  national products, it said.      Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased  industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank  said.      Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on  futures markets, has also risen. These factors and South  Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a  temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country,  underline the firmer sentiment, it said.      However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90  tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.  "
gnp,"BALLADUR SEES ONLY TWO PCT FRENCH GROWTH IN 1987  French 1987 growth will probably be about  two pct, the same as last year, due to an international  environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance  Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.      Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross  domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct  this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.      Although in line with the latest Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimate of 2.1 pct growth,  the forecast will be balanced by growth in investments and  exports, Balladur said in an interview with the daily Les  Echos.      Last month Balladur said French GDP had grown by just two  pct last year, compared with an initial 1986 target of 2.5 pct  and 1.1 pct growth in 1985.      He told Les Echos he aims to reduce the 1988 budget deficit  to 115 billion francs from this year's figure of 129 billion  and compared with a 141 billion deficit in 1985.

nat-gas,"EXXON &lt;XON> OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ROSE IN 1986  Exxon Corp said in its annual report  that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace  all oil and gas produced.      The company said that it added about four pct to production  bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based  largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions  to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions  did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.      The company said that the average price for oil and gas  declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38  pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.      Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986  fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.      Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from  the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from  oil sands in Canada.      Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for  expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe  and the Far East.      But capital expenditures for exploration and production  were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year  and further reductions were expected in 1987.      Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas  liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached  a new high of 422,000 bpd.      The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea  fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to  sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower  quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded  over the past several years.      The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon  more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to  earnings gains from refining and marketing.      Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations  rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs  in 1985.      The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043  mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs  rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.      Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500  mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery  completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in  Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes  to extract higher proportions of light products.

""Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall  slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to  increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,""  Murray said.      Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures  have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5  billion dlrs in 1985.      Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts ""the company  has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas  reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and  Indonesia.      Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring  of its domestic exploration and development organization and  this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which  support the new affiliate.      ""Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we  need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our  assets,"" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman.      Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which  will combine its current three exploration and producing  affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and  Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present  organization and will improve the company's upstream  competitive position.      Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its  Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance  the development and transfer of technology supporting critical  areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and  computer systems.      Earnings from Mobil's upstream operations in 1986 were 827  mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year's 1.8 billion dlrs  in earnings.      Mobil's strategy in the exploration and production sector  will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities  with the greatest long term potential, the company said.      In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include  greater emphasis on ""frontier plays that, although riskier, fit  our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means  a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective  overseas exploration offers greater potential.""

January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5  pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in  services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's  level.      January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a  year ago.      The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for  goods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in  manufacturing and construction.      Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,  machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.  Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles  and parts, however.      In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and  communication were more than offset by declines in  transportation, storage and the retail trade.  "

De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration  officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference  there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and  oils used in the 12 EC countries.      But he added, ""I do not think it will be a big issue because  there will be a big debate inside Europe,"" adding ""so there will  be a compromise.""      U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday  that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United  States would respond ""vigorously"" to protect its trade rights and  access to community markets.      De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone  its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to  cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was  made toward resolving differences with the United States.      U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and  the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.      He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal  with another controversial health proposal that would forbid  the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the  United States.      De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be  resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.

A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on  Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow  at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of  Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd &lt;FSCN.J>.      The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at  the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the  affected shaft because of what the company described as ""the  creation of unsafe working conditions.""      Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the  company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers  (NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims a  membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish  the cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the  mine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give  estimates.      Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of  gold from 28 underground shafts.      The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the  action. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South  African Press Association that miners had been locked out of  the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest  against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as  well as food for white miners.

The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand,  is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co  Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd &lt;VO.N>. Thailand's state  oil company &lt;Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a  major stake in the field.      PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to  consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.      PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with  Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's  holdings in the field.      ""PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.  When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking  over a 30 pct share in the field,"" Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen  told Reuters.      Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal  of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has  estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost  of some 700 mln crowns.      Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower  reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little  interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its  upgraded reserve estimate for the field.      The field's reserves could be sold domestically through  Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to  electricity, the sources said.      Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.  "

The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an  additional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana,  contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier.      The original concession appears to have a substantial  amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or  6/100 ounces, of gold per tonne. But the venture has no firm  estimate on the costs of extracting the gold and no assurances  can be given that the reserves can be mined profitably, the  company said. It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted  tests on the newly granted land but added the land seems to be  similar in geological characteristics to the original land.  "

They said production was conditional on approval of a water  license and arrangement of appropriate financing. They  estimated development costs for the mine and mill would total  21.1 mln dlrs, including three mln dlrs of working capital.      The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49,600  ounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton, they  said.      Canamax and Pacific Trans-Ocean said the project would  yield a 40 pct after-tax real rate of return at a gold price of  400 U.S. dlrs an ounce.      They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven and  probable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce gold  per ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of  4.25 years.      Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce gold  per ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year,  with considerable potential for development of further oxide  ore reserves at the deposit, they said.

The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the  cash settled contracts introduced last year.      ""This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our  marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts,"" LMFE official  Peter Freeman said. ""These two have already shown their  effectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is  increasing,"" he added.

""We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves  rather than just exploration,"" Conger said adding, ""the move to  consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's  acquisitions policy.""      Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120  mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,  Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which  have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an  acquisition, he said.      Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be  about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said  exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than  last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas  exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6  pct.      Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about  the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.      However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400  ounces due to start-up production problems.      He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400  U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.       IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market  price for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.

gnp,"S. AFRICAN RESERVE BANK SAYS GROWTH RATE ON TARGET  South Africa recorded annualised  real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this  year and the economy should achieve the government's target of  three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.      The South African central bank said in its quarterly  bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January  to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the  nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement  in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.      It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the  third and fourth quarters of last year.      It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement  reached with international creditors in March as evidence of  improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.      The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most  repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term  foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.      South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised  surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of  7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus  of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth  consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.  "
livestock,"HOG REPORT SHOWS MORE HOGS ON FARMS  The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report  yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year  as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged  producers to step up production, analysts said.      Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile  Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as  bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply  lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in  nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.      University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,""The  report shows that hog producers have responded to a very  desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10  months.""      Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures  prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures  fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still  lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy  selling pressure today.      ""We have not had a period of profitability of this  magnitude since last summer,"" Levitt said. ""In fact, hog  operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been  so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back  on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog  operation alone.""      Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was  negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the  slaughter increased from the previous year.      We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we  didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state  spring report, Levitt added.      High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that  could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased  profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to  increase production starting late last year.      Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog  herd resulted from a revision of the December report and  without the revision, the March report might have been very  close to average expectations.      Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major  upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding  herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more  bearish than initially indicated.      But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report  to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant  contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because  traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.      Discounts in the October and December contracts take into  consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May  farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1  report, Fuller said.      Grimes said, ""As far as the distant months are concerned,  if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60  lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a  tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us  to push down to the prices that the current futures show for  the July and August period.""      Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that  distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than  they were last summer.      ""If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs  during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper  this year because we have six pct more numbers,"" he said.  "

""A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock  exchanges,"" Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for  further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.      Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.      Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many  investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.      Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock  exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.      Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's  foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is  poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half  of this year.      The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an  ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and  430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.  "

It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid  reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates  caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This  accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision  of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision  occurring in the United States, the report said.      Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its  worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last  year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased  298 billion cubic feet of reserves.      Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these  gains, the report said.      All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14  mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United  States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to  acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.      Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions ""will be an  integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available  at attractive prices.""

It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in  1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.      The utility said these totals exclude spending on New  England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity  from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this  venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.      The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln  dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission  lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.      New England Electric said internally generated funds will  cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and  65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan  to spend in 1987.      The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on  its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally  generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.      New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs  worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional  higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit  plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year  as well.      The company said it does not plan to offer common shares  this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise  about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its  dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.      President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the  construction spending projection is based on the expectation  that demand for electricity in the New England electric system  will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.      However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for  sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2  pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.      He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices  and a strong New England economy.      Huntington said New England Elecetric has ""all but rejected  new coal fired plants"" to supply additional power.      He said the most attractive new power supplies are those  with short lead times which can be built in modules.      Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is  looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply  most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired  fluidized bed units.      He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in  modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the  traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.  "

Results of an economic evaluation of the find, in which  Placer has an option with &lt;Australian Consolidated Minerals  Ltd> (ACM) to earn a 50 pct interest, were encouraging enough  to warrant a full study, Placer said in a statement.

nat-gas,"LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987  Liquefied natural gas imports from  Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its  economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.      Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian  state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in  Algiers that such imports would be made this year.      ""Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and  the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay  the import until 1988/1989,"" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas  analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.      Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former  customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary  of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials  told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington  Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.      Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were  feasible. ""On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have  made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate  profitably even in the current price environment,""  Frank  Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.     Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports  on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend  higher by the end of 1987.      A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of  Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm  prices, Shearson's Tulis said.     In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of  supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.      Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,  saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.      Company sources also said that any negotiations with  Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate  volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market  values.  "

livestock,"U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS  Leading U.S. farm state senators are  seeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a  provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the  U.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,  to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including  the Soviet Union, Senate staff said.      Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to  recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading  practices.      Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)  is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to  broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be  eligible for the subsidies, sources said.      The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman  Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor  (D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --  also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork  producers and processors from Canadian imports.      The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),  would clarify the definition of ""industry"" in determining whether  or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.      Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the  International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live  swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming  U.S. producers.      The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply  replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.  "

It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment  period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by  Commissioner Charles Stalon.      FERC said in a press release that ""the proposed policy  statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general  policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be  recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates.""      FERC added that ""specifically, in cases where pipelines  assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the  commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the  remaining costs through their demand rates.""      It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming  existing contracts to help spread the impact of these  take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.      Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said ""this proposal  represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the  industry through this difficult period of transition to a more  competitive market.""      Hesse said ""it is my hope that our proposed policy will  encourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay  contractual disputes that have impeded the industry's  transition to a more competitive environment.

gnp,"DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH  Dutch economic growth is slowing as a  firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries  reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning  agency CPB said.      The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic  outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to  grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in  1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.      Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20  billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase  from last year's 423.95 billion.      The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of  the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct  last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average  of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.      ""The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit  labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while  these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,"" the CPB said.      More of economic growth now depended on domestic  consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set  by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on  purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.      Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the  CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.      Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five  pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last  year, the CPB said.      Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to  condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent  years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of  these factors on Dutch competitiveness.      In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social  security costs to employers.      The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2  pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year,  urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down  the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in  future.      Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by  falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.      It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this  year from 710,000 last year.      While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is  within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two  pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.      Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in  its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant  prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts  had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own  latest estimate.      ""It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole  document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some  of our estimates,"" a Pierson economist said.      The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in  1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy  exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.      Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with  four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.      The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the  surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1  billion last year, the CPB forecast.  "
gnp,"BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TO CUT FINANCIAL REQUIREMENT  Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried  Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987  government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.      He said this will enable the requirement to be held to  419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of  417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.      Martens said following a lowering of government estimates  of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government  departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that  unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the  target by 22.5 billion francs.      Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts  by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.  The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through  treasury operations.      Martens said the money is being found through a series of  small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of  two billion francs through the sale of part of the government's  50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.      Last year, the government announced a major program  designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.      The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the  government said was a ""snowball effect"" under which the  government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits  which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying  existing debt.      In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated  at 561 billion francs or 11.0 pct of GNP.  "
gnp,"SOUTH AFRICA GDP UP 4.7 PCT IN 1986 LAST QUARTER  The South African Reserve Bank,  confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product  in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual  rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct  in the 1985 final quarter.      The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal  growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a  1.5 pct contraction in 1985.      But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is  taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct  compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985.      GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an  economy but omits income from abroad.  GNP includes such  payments or outflows.      The bank also said there were indications the country's  economic recovery was becoming more broadly based.      With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the  economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic  production.      The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were  recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987.  Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February.      Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70  billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total  annual value of import payments.      The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand  in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year.      The bank said continuing strength of the current account  has allowed foreign reserves to be ""rebuilt to more comfortable  levels.""      ""This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending  support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to  be called for,"" the bank said.  "
nat-gas,"PHILLIPS &lt;P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT  Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize  improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt,  C.J. ""Pete"" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.      ""Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets  already installed,"" he said, but he declined to estimate annual  cash flow for 1987.      Analysts estimate Phillips"" cash flow at over one billion  dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from  restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers  about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.       Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising  the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas  properties.      ""We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash  flow prospects,"" he said. He projected a capital expenditure  budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln  dlrs.      Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and  production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas  said.      ""Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the  waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to  improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,"" Silas  said.       Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to  cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross  barrels of oil over a period of 24 years.      Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas  said he was seeking ""a modification of terms with the Chinese  government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang  fields) commercially viable.""      In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point  Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. ""We  expect to start up the first platform then,"" Silas said.      But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the  company to part with several oil and gas assets.      Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.  North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in  1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is  now completed, Silas said.       ""We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good  value for us but possibly so for someone else,"" Silas said.      Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings  for the company.      ""Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we  are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while  regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,"" Silas said.      He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil  prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for  several months. ""Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of  assets), and we're no different from the others,"" Silas said.      In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from  Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in  earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.      ""This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and  demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs  for our operations,"" Silas said, ""In 1987 we think the market's  supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock  and energy costs will rise due to price recovery.""

livestock,"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS  Commodities from gold to grains to  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of  inflation and economic instability.      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term  direction of the currency markets.      ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If  they do, it's not evident.""      ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market  take values to where they should be.      ""One way or another, we will force our major trading  partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.      ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's  happening,"" he said.      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of  Dominick and Dominick.      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton  posted broad gains.      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate  export demand.      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately  higher.      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field  work to market animals.  "
gold,"PROPOSED JAPAN TAX MAY DAMPEN TOKYO GOLD TRADING  A proposed sales tax on gold transactions  could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of  trading to Hong Kong and Singapore, senior vice president and  Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press  conference.      ""If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions,  Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business,""  he said. The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would  be unable to compete in the international market, he added.      ""How can the government really raise taxes if the system  they impose is prohibitive of generating business?"" he said.      The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades  exceeding 37,500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 2.5 yen  tax per 10,000 yen on futures transactions, gold dealers said.      The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading  more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades,  gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as  that of jewellery and coins, dealers said.      However, the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and  coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct, they said.      Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 5.6 pct gold  turnover tax on Jan 1, 1980, but abolished it on Oct 1, 1986.      A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early  1980, the first year of the tax, the volume for all Swiss banks  fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979, Hofer said.      Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the  volume prior to imposition of the tax, he said.      While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased, the  volume of trades outside the country, particularly in London  and Luxembourg, increased between 10-25 pct, Hofer said.      Japan is a major importer of gold, buying a yearly average  just under 200 tonnes, gold dealers said.      Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold, but the  government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to  commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign, dealers  said.      Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese  trading companies, while Credit Suisse is the major foreign  participant.      Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one  and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes, while  futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes, gold dealers  said.      ""All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo  market is growing, that Japan is becoming one of the three  major financial markets in the world ... And in my personal  opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper  on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax,""  Hofer said.      ""I don't think it fits the philosophy of an  internationalising market,"" he added.      Officials of several major Japanese trading houses,  attending the press conference, said they supported Credit  Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax.  "
gnp,"WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN  a confidential world bank report on the  peruvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer  good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to  quickly lead to inflation.      The report, published today by an economic monthly, the  peru report, said the success of president alan garcia's  government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct  gross domestic product growth ""represents gains in the short  term at the expense of the long.""      Government officials had no immediate comment on the  report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the  public investment programme and greater emphasis on the  preservation of peru's export potential.      The report said that although the government had succeeded  in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to  under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was  encountering increasing difficulties.      ""an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to  monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of  price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added.    "

The new product, porcine somatotropin (PST) is described as  a natural bio-synthetic protein that improves the lean weight  and rate of weight gain, as well as reduces the cost of feed  for market hogs, the company said.

gnp,"IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS  The Belgian government, which  introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year,  has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is  scope for further cuts in 1988.      The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions  of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic  policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the  weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.      The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest  rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.      The team's report to the government praises last year's  spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending  by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy  perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in  the 1980s.""      However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation  of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much  lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the  government has set itself for 1989.      The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of  GNP in 1986.      The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the next  few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of  general Government.""      It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax  system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax  burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the  debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.      ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure  growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions,  we feel that your position would be stronger if you could  decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the  report adds.      The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the  government's determination to keep its currency strong and to  curb inflation.      It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net  long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.      It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and  an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the  subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in  Belgian francs.  "
gnp,"HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS  France's growth rate is expected to  strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first  half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.      In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD  forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the  rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly  higher than in the first half of this year.      The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated  somewhat during the early months of 1987.       Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory  adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation  has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to  reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.      The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand  pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are  likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.      The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for  the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six  months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct  for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.  "
gnp,"FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY  Momentum in th U.S. economy may be  picking up given solid across-the board increases in the  February U.S. employment report, economists said.      U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February,  twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a  319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously  reported 448,000 increase.      ""Even if you look at January and February together, this is  still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in  the market,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.      Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much  larger gains in February U.S. production and income than  previously forecast.      The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from  34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose  0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since  November 1966, the Commerce Department said.      ""The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very  large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7  pct,"" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4  pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.      Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc  noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour  in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.      ""Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means  we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis  the wage and salary disbursement,"" he said.      Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should  rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.      He said the February employment gains are consistent with  his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product  growth forecast of 3.7 pct.      Economists agreed that the employment data were negative  for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy  and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But  most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.      ""This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider  easing,"" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.      ""It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,"" he  said. ""If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,  but it's most likely they'll sit and wait.""      ""The data have not been uniform,"" Stone added. ""Durable  goods were weak in January and now employment is strong.""      In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,  followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.  retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap  widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.      ""Things just aren't adding up,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman  Goverment Securities Inc. ""Consumer spending, capital spending,  goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first  quarter GNP growth of one pct,"" he said.      ""The employment and production data point to a big  inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth  quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.""      Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000  in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was  accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery  industries returning to work.      Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains  have resulted from an improving trade outlook.      Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.  trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports  grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in  imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve  in the first quarter.      ""Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,  but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper  products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show  that trade is improving,"" Benderley said.      ""The economy is moving between extremes,"" he said. ""Some  reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter  GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.""      A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater  part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment  rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in  January, previously reported at 166,000.      Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But  this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down  from a previously reported 142,000 gain.      The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in  February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at  6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since  March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.      ""The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,""  Carson said. ""This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,  but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that.""  "
nat-gas,"DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY  The U.S. Congress and the oil industry  are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the  industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the  subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.      ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an  oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,""  said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research  Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.  Congress on energy issues.      Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax  incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.      Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will  propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural  gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for  consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the  proposal would be reviewed.      Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels  a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to  8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last  year, the American Petroleum Institute said.      Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average  about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a  move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.      Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that  ""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've  only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for  the year.""      Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and  exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output  will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable  prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.      John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry  Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to  Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is  virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But  the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil  prices and U.S. government policy.""      Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil  production but would only work over time.      ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably  be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but  would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said.      But the small independent oil companies who do much of the  drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief  which could be brought on by an oil import fee.      Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International  Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our  trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil  import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our  nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil  service companies.      The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee  will face a stiff uphill battle.      Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by  a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil  import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a  means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.       At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed  opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would  hurt consumers and some regional interests.      But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow  if production continued to fall and imports to rise.      Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements  ""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above  that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will  certainly be pressure for some form of action.""       But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct  rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.      In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy  requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.  "
gnp,"CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET  The Philippines' first quarter growth  figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely  to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose  Fernandez said in an interview.      The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)  announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct  and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter  from a year earlier.      ""I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it  (growth) short,"" Fernandez said.       NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the  fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP  growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.      ""Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources  and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that  domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and  would not be a stumbling block,"" Fernandez said.      ""I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at  key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,  showed that the economy was on a different track from last  year,"" he said.      Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the  first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it  could drop off in the third quarter.      He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the  manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in  1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.      ""That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said.      He said the government had met all monetary targets set for  the first quarter in consultation with the International  Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth  tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.      The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling  58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.  Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or  August to review performance in the January-June period.      He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion  dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.  Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their  net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.      ""It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA  (official development assistance) accounts the commercial  banking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said.      It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF  debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.      The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28  billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.      Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984  to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in  April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in  October last year, had almost been completed.      He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level  touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.  ""Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said.      Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, ""I  think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own  receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap  forward as might have been suitable.""      The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach  29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.      NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first  quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.      Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of  between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while  growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.      Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some  economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the  dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more  competitive.      ""By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso  has already substantially devalued against all of the country's  trading partners,"" he said.      On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was  opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted  repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two  years after the imposition of the Code.      The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has  been delayed by objections from some business groups.      ""I think any central bank, certainly this one after the  events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be  prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds  and I'm not about to do that,"" Fernandez said.      ""It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of  capital and earnings can be free,"" he said.      ""We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly  we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external  availabilities simply by servicing our debts.""  "
gnp,"SWEDISH GNP ROSE LESS THAN EXPECTED, FIGURES SHOW  Sweden's Gross National Product rose  1.3 pct last year against 2.3 pct in 1985, mainly due to a  lower than forecast growth in exports and a sharp fall in total  investments, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.      Private consumption rose 4.1 pct during 1986 against 2.7  pct in 1985 whereas the Finance Ministry had expected an  increase of only 3.6 pct. Total investments fell 0.7 pct  against a rise of 6.3 pct in 1985. The Finance Ministry had  forecast a rise of 0.3 pct in 1986.

gold,"CANAMAX, PACIFIC TRANS-OCEAN APPROVE PRODUCTION  &lt;Canamax Resources Inc> and &lt;Pacific  Trans-Ocean Resources Ltd> said they conditionally approved  starting production at their jointly owned Ketza River gold  deposit in the Yukon after a study recommended the move.      They said production was conditional on approval of a water  license and arrangement of appropriate financing. They  estimated development costs for the mine and mill would total  21.1 mln dlrs, including three mln dlrs of working capital.      The feasibility study anticipated gold production of 49,600  ounces a year at a cost of 129 Canadian dlrs a short ton, they  said.      Canamax and Pacific Trans-Ocean said the project would  yield a 40 pct after-tax real rate of return at a gold price of  400 U.S. dlrs an ounce.      They said they would mine 460,000 tonnes of proven and  probable mineable reserves of oxide ore grading 0.45 ounce gold  ton at a yearly rate of 112,000 tonnes for a mine life of 4.25  years.      Possible reserves of 75,000 tonnes grading 0.38 ounce gold  ton at the break zone would extend mine life by a year, with  considerable potential for development of further oxide ore  reserves at the deposit, they said.  "
gnp,"PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS  Portugal's economy, which has been  enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest  government crisis, analysts said.      But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco  Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment  as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European  Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.      Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was  toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.      The centre-right administration had made economic growth  reform a priority in its 17 months in office.      In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current  account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and  inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.      Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability  were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued  growth had not been badly shaken.      ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is  now less dependent on the political situation,"" said Fritz  Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.      ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economist  Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.      Businessmen have identified political instability over the  last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting  economic progress.      The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974  revolution.      Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain  buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge  in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely  underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.      Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of  Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth  would remain at similar levels this year.      But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies  and could slow economic development.      Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end  of the month, can either call early elections or form a new  government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated  parliament.      Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick  elections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that a  majority government could result from early elections,""  Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro  Ferraz da Costa said.      He said they were optimistic this could mean the  continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies  introduced over the last year.      The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but  the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls  say they could win an overall majority.      A PSD majority would also open the way for more  wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and  possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.      Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties  of blocking key economic reforms.      The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results  were more the product of favourable international conditions  such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD  policies.  "

gnp,"OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND  West German economic growth will slow to  1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic  demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its  semi-annual review of the world economy.      This view is less favourable than the West German  government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this  year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic  institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.      The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,  with the gross national product rising by two pct in real  terms.      The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing  through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some  recovery in business confidence in the near future.      But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy  was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by  2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.      While noting that the government is bringing forward a five  billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""the  medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy  could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow  relatively lower tax rates.""      Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal  Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP  actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of  this year compared with the final three months of 1986.      Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared  likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of  the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.      West Germany's current account surplus, the target of  considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is  expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from  35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in  1988.

gnp,"NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY FORECAST TO IMPROVE IN 1987/88  New Zealand's inflation and interest  rates should decline and the balance of payments improve  significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the  Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said.      The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue  that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic  product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct  drop forecast in December.      Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in  the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter.      The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and  September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and  the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax  and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87.      The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to  change, it said.      Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is  forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in  calendar 1986, it said.      ""Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for  reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are  also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of  payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls  away,"" the NZIER said.      Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20  and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the  second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term  rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct.      Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and  the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct.      The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the  early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on  the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a  basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4.      ""A marked improvement in the balance of payments is  forecast,"" the NZIER said. ""The current account deficit is  expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in  1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88.""      The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32  billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and  3.33 billion in 1985/86.      The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion  dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87  billion in 1985/86.      This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure  of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion.      ""Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to  contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of  payments and the rate of inflation ...,"" the NZIER said.      ""Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand  economy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well  for future prospects.""  "

livestock,"U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE  Four U.S. meat processors have asked  the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which  they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,  the U.S. Agriculture Department said.      The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,  Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow  mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as  the species from which it was derived.      For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients  statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork.""      Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product  would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically  separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat  and poultry portion of the product.      Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost  product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.      Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated  ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry  product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient  statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said.      USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid  using mechanically separated meat in their products because the  term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds  of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar  regulation exists for poultry products.      Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass  parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some  remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.  "

gnp,"FED'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT  The Federal Reserve's move to easier  monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate  cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the  second quarter, analysts said.      A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to  edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate  from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.      ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without  a full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financial  economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.      Stone said economic data available by late June may be just  weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said  it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half  point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.      All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market  Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.      The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly  quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury  bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which  banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime  lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.      Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to  the April-June quarter, follow:      - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further  against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget  deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after  the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the  economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that  the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.      - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue  trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well  test the lower end of that range.      - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and  probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong  foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The  outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year  since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.      - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator  will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The  sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will  a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.      - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct  annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at  respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first  and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct  annual  rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees  both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among  those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct  rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this  quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.      ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than many  expect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in  inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter  economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.      ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economy  afloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His  interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.      Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation  helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.  He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second  quarter growth could be zero or negative.      Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer  from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow   government spending and less construction. Only a marginally  narrower trade deficit will add to growth.      He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,  with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,  respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for  bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.      Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly  after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past  days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.      David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc  raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20  pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.      Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted  his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point  to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and  Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.      The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese  investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear  about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.  trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.  ......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS....  ....................T-bonds..Fed funds..Prime..  Nikko Securities.....8.25......6.15......7.75..

gnp,"AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP  The strong contribution of exports to  the growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the  fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of  the data, private economists polled by Reuters said.      Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after  rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year  earlier.      Equally significant was the decline in both private and  government spending, they said.      Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth  quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau  figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government  spending by 0.2.      Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account  deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut  imports appeared to be working.      However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep  growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports  would increase and worsen the balance of payments.      Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the  result was positive because growth was export-driven.      But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the  growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.      The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul  Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.      Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a  reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline  in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.      A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter  underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and  public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's  competitiveness, he said.      ""It is clear that through the continued application of that  strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its  external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth  pattern,"" he added.

The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report  the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter,  partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and  capital spending in manufacturing industries.      The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year  starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the  Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the  year.      The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually  rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the  past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy.      Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to  90.2 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated  98 billion in the current fiscal year, it said.  "

nat-gas,"ENERGY/U.S. OIL OUTPUT  Energy Secretary John Herrington has  proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said  all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close  White House scrutiny before action is taken.      One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion  allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as  production using enhanced extraction methods.      Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.  The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the  tax code, but would look at the proposal.      Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along  with the release last week of the energy department's report on  energy and the national security.      The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit  50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging  implications for national security.      He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that  any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production  would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not  cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.      Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,  spurring production but fail the second and third.      He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil   workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil  prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide  and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.      A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria  by not increasing domestic production.      In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains  firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.      Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:      - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by  borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if  oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that  could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.      - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It  would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000  barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.      - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical  expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a  day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.      - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to  spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for  the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower  the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.      Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration  proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut  the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.      He also called again for Congressional approval to explore  off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion  barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which  may hold nine billion barrels.      Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to   amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these  proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security  study would make a strong case for the need to help the  struggling domestic oil industry.      Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even  though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to  raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to  100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.      This, he said, would further bolster national security in  case of an oil-supply disruption.  "

But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in  unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the  ministry said.      The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of  the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries  such as Italy.      These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3  pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985.      They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance.      On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national  statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986  of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a  previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and  compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985.  "

nat-gas,"SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT  Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi  Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according  to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.      Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167  billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft  from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.      Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about  200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi  Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per  day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.        Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as  OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture  their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed  from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the  organisation decided to cut production again from last  September onwards.      Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.      Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly  to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the  official Saudi Press Agency.      The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the  number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.        Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44  mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was  upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling  it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the  report said.      The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by  another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced  around 750,000 bpd last year.        Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from  998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began  operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes  per day, the report said.      Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4  billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.  "

nat-gas,"SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL  Leading Australian onshore oil and gas  producer, Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit  by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and  liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).      The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net  profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.      Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement  that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along  with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil  exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal  with an adverse business climate.      Santos said it remained financially strong with an  injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985  rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the  end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.      It said it had also made significant progress in repaying  debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds  had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.      Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid  for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas  company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln  dlrs.      Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar  denominated and significant currency purchases were made during  the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held  145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.      Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,  finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil  exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to  reserves -- less than depletion during the year.      Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme  to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for  oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.      Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and  production volumes but with extra oil exploration and  encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.      But it called on the goverment to continue fostering  domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.      ""It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when  exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when  Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,""  Massy-Green said.

nat-gas,"ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS  Lured by the weakening dollar and the  conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European  energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves  to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.      They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable  United States is good insurance against future shortages.  However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up  competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.  institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice  domestic oil properties.      Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and  gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers  had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All  buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a  barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for  acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five  dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.      ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but  we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said  Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and  president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.      ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and  gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added.      Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe  the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because  of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that  oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to  buy new reserves than to explore for them.      Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to  the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and  general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.      In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,  French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie  Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to  separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC>  and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome  said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.      A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.>  and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy  virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>,  the Oklahoma pipeline firm.      But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures  with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's  &lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a  100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with  Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.      Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its  geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are  more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions  than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.      Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing  International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag  Corp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had  earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in  Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.      But he called that a small amount compared to the amount  other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne  Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up  to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.      ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign  investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil  companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we  feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If  you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need  prices higher than the current market,"" he added.      In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage  houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also  competing for prime properties.      Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group  &lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and  selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired  two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of  oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.      ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these  companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one  mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may  drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.""  "
gnp,"BRAZIL SAYS DEBT CRISIS IS WORLD PROBLEM  Brazilian Finance Minister  Dilson Funaro said his country's foreign debt crisis could only  be solved by changes in the international financial system.      Speaking to a business conference he said ""It is not Brazil  that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International  Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community  that is taking away resources from the developing countries.""      ""The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the  third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had  remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only  two billion in fresh funds,"" he added.      Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe  and Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspend  interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he  stressed the country's commitment to growth.      ""We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt  problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop  growing,"" he said, adding that political and not purely  commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis.      Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest  in the developing world, has been under pressure from official  and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment  program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign  payments problems.      President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refused  to approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead  to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he  had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of  finding a lasting solution to the debt problem.      ""We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be  one of continuous crisis.""      To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more  machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw  materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this  year's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986's 9.5  billion.      Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction  in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic  product in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should  fall to 1.5 pct this year.

The system calls on the agency to buy beef from trading  houses and simultaneously sell it to users in one tender. The  tender quota in April-September is 10 pct of the agency's beef  import share. Japan's beef import quota in 1987/88 was set at  93,000 tonnes against 85,000 for the same period in 1986/87.  "
gnp,"BANK OF JAPAN SATISFIED WITH YEN AT CURRENT RANGE  The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the  yen around its current range, a senior central bank official  told reporters.      He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris  last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current  ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar  rise.      Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency  stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other  policies and with other central banks, he said.      The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability  will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but  declined to be more specific.      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday  the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily  satisfactory for the Japanese economy.      Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the  official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a  completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.  Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government  officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.      The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross  national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in  the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little  changed from the performance expected this year.      Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but  the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of  nearly one percentage point, he said.      He said there was virtually no room for further monetary  policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance  in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.      The central bank's monetary policy has already done its  part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.  The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the  last year and a half.      Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of  inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.  ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may  still be wet,"" he added.      Liquidity among private households and especially the  corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.      The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock  exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds  into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may  continue, he said.      The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping  Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when  his current term expires later this year.      ""He's a great man,"" the official said, adding that more and  more people expect his reappointment.      Turning to exchange rates, the official said the  substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect  on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the  impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the  U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so  far it has not been very strong, he said.  "
gnp,"U.S. HOUSING DATA FAIL TO CLARIFY ECONOMIC PATH  Surprisingly strong U.S. housing  statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that  the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient  cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,  economists said.      Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually  mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that  seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the  economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And  after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.      U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804  mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April  1986.      The rate at which permits were issued for future building  climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764  mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.      ""February's weather is usually more adverse for home  building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to  determine what this means for the economy down the road,"" said  Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.      The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for  weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures  inflate the statistics.      Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to  building last month. But several believe that rates will now  consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.      ""Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying  'Let's do it now',"" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of  Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much  of the financing for home building.      But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward  potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and   some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.      He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early  summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last  November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.      As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in  the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which  typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high  vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units  following tax law changes effective January 1.      Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317  mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.      ""Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low  mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not  looking at a great deal of growth potential,"" said Ward  McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.      McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with  larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial  output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers  to start waving ""four pct GNP banners"" for the first quarter.  Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.      But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to  come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not  convinced that growth will pick up in future.      ""The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on  now, not all of which is intentional,"" he said. For example,  U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,  produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February  compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.      Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first  quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker  growth in the second, he said.      ""If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building  and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then  there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,""  agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating  first quarter GNP prospects.      Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that  current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.      ""At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the  first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the  second,"" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei  Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

gnp,"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS  The government must announce harsh cuts  in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give  an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ  Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said.      Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the  backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14  billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly  Business Indicators publication.      ""For the past two years, the government has struggled with  an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it  sees as politically practicable,"" it said.      The political climate meant there would be a continued  over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and  maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.      ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival  of business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.      The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by  export and import-replacement industries which had created a  false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of  payments crisis were past. ""Unfortunately, successful adjustment  to Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a  long-term process,"" it said.      In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate  overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)  rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.      The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP  this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow  strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at  end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.      Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988  from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were  expected, ANZ said.  "
gnp,"OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA  Australia faces a major medium term  adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance,  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said  in its latest annual review of the Australian economy.      It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-3/4  pct of gross domestic product, high and rapidly rising external  debt equal to 30 pct of GDP, growing servicing costs and  inflation above nine pct, far higher than that of other OECD  countries.      A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis  for sustained non-inflationary growth and external  competitiveness had improved, but economic performance overall  had sharply deteriorated since June 1985.      A major shift of real resources to the external sector --  about 4-1/2 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the  economy to expand in line with potential, for employment to  grow, and for the debt/GDP ratio to stabilize, it said.      Success depended on the setting of right policies including  tighter fiscal policy, a reduction in the public sector  borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour.      Looking ahead over the next 18 months, the OECD expected  economic performance to improve, partly as a result of tighter  fiscal and monetary policy, and a substantial improvement in  trade volumes.      It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored,  the current external deficit could fall to some 4-1/2 pct of  GDP by the first half of next year, while inflation was  projected to decelerate to around five to 5-1/2 pct by  mid-1988.      Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain  the competitive edge created by the Australian dollar's  depreciation, and to maintain if not boost profit shares in  order to encourage business investment.      The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by  developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing  industries, and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to  correct its external imbalances.      It added Australia should reduce protection levels in  manufacturing, even though faster trade liberalisation would no  doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry.  "
nat-gas,"STANDARD OIL &lt;SRD> SEES BOOST IN 1987 CASH FLOW  Standard Oil Co expects the sale of  assets and federal tax refunds resulting from last year's loss  to add about one billion dlrs to its normal cash flows from  operations in 1987, its annual report said.      Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations  dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and  3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices.      The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>  disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard's stock, put 1987  capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion  dlrs projected in January.      Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in  1986.      The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41  billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a  year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4  mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985.      But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet  from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic  feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during  1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion  cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added.      Standard said both oil and gas production increased last  year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the  previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in  1985.      But the average sales price of both dropped -- to 13.83  dlrs per barrel from 26.43 dlrs for oil in 1985 and to 1.49  dlrs per thousand cubic feet from 2.18 dlrs a year earlier.      Standard said its refined product sales also rose last  year, to 644,500 barrels per day from 604,200 barrels daily in  1985.  "
livestock,"LIVE CATTLE RALLY AS LOCKOUT AT MEAT PLANT ENDS  Live cattle futures posted a robust  rally today after a major beef packing company said it would  end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb.      April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market  expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant  restarts operations.      Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum,  said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the  nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14,  the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the  United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired.      The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several  thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said.      The company said it locked out union workers because they  threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union  meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the company's  latest contract offer March 5.      Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors  circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further  fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on  cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle.      The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and  frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications  that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate  than previously expected.      Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York  Mercantile Exchange.      But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the  price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday,  said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith  Barney, Harris Upham and Co.      Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices  recover from early weakness, traders said.      Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the  silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver  prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its  customers buy the metal, traders said.      Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that  Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said.      Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar  and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European  Commission on Wednesday.      Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the  Chicago Board of Trade.      Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture  Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation  Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible  land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said.      Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt  exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just  beginning, also underpinned prices, they said.      Wheat prices were pressured by selling in response to  trends on price charts, they said.  "
gnp,"ITALIAN GDP ROSE 2.4 PCT IN 1986 FOURTH QUARTER  Italy's Gross Domestic Product, calculated  at 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986,  compared with the same period in 1985, National Statistics  Institute ISTAT said.      ISTAT said in a statement that GDP growth in fourth quarter  1986 was zero compared with the preceding quarter. Italy's  budget ministry said last month that 1986 GDP rose 2.7 pct in  real terms from 1985.      Imports in the fourth quarter totalled 26,361 billion lire,  down 1.4 pct from the 1985 fourth quarter and down 6.6 pct from  the third 1986 quarter, ISTAT said.      Istat said exports totaled 23,190 billion lire in the  fourth quarter, down 4.1 pct from the comparable 1985 quarter  and down 6.7 pct from the third quarter in 1986.      Fixed investments were 23,438 billion lire in the fourth  quarter, down 0.7 pct from the preceding quarter and up 1.1 pct  from the comparable 1985 quarter.  "
gnp,"ECONOMISTS CUT AUSTRIAN GDP GROWTH FORECAST  The Institute for Economic Research  (WIFO) said it has cut its forecast for Austria's 1987 gross  domestic product growth to a real one pct from a two pct  forecast made last December.      WIFO chief Helmut Kramer told a new conference that he saw  the one pct figure, which compares with 1.8 pct last year, as  the upper limit of growth. The institute had made the revision  due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.      A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil  producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's  fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.      Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this  year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private  consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct  in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.      Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2  pct last year due to the slack economic activity.      Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit  of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion  surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's  central bank, last month forecast the current account would be  roughly in balance this year.      However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have  no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the  budget deficit. This year's aim of reducing the deficit to 4.9  pct of GDP from 5.1 pct in 1986 could still be achieved, he  said.  "

Nerco said it estimates the field's total proved developed  and undeveloped reserves at 24 billion cubic feet, or  equivalent, of natural gas, which more than doubles the  company's previous reserves.      The field is located in southern Louisiana.  "
gnp,"U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS  The economy faces lackluster growth  and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement  in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.      Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness  in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further  hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.      ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength  to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said Lyle  Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers  Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.      The Commerce Department said this week that the economy  grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but  a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.      Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending  rose a weak 0.1 per cent.      ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --  are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""  Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,  told Reuters.      Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow  because inflation is rising faster than real wages.      To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,  returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost  personal income and consumption, he says.      ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to  keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""  Gramley said.      Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters  that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the  result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last  and said the recovery was showing anemia.      Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The pace  of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into  monetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be  accommodative.      Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct  forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if  the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add  to the risk of a recession.      Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May  came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an  inventory overhang still exists.      He says the boost in production came from smaller  industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have  improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.      ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in  economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a  recession,"" Mauro said.      In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl  Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the  trade deficit will continue to improve.      ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and  into 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said.      But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in  inflation.      Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers  Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5  to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after  a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.      The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil  and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.      ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets  out of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding he  would like the Fed to tighten credit.      A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the  dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says  a prominent international banker.      Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National  Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and  the mark will continue for years because the United States is  the world's largest debtor nation.      The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a  further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that  the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.  ""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said.  "

The export sales will be subsidized with commodities from  the inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), the  department said.      Indonesia and Turkey already have purchased 7,500 and 5,000  head of dairy cattle, respectively, under the program.      Details of the program and an invitation for offers from  exporters will be issued in the near future, it said.  "
nat-gas,"U.S. ENERGY COSTS ROSE IN FEBRUARY BY 1.9 PCT  Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct  in February following a sharp rise last month, the Labor  Department said.      The February increase in the overall energy costs,  including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct  drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said.      Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels.      The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the cost  of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise  in January.      Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their  levels as of February 1986.      Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas  rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the  year-ago figure.      The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were  unchanged last month, but down 3.5 pct from the February 1986  figure, the department said.      The index has been updated  o reflect 1982-84 consumption  patterns; previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns.  "
nat-gas,"ENERGY/DRILLING INDUSTRY  The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling  last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas  bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next  winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts  said.      Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that  is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could  more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by  1990, some analysts said.      The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities  and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of  activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of  the nation's largest gas reserves are located.      ""We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,"" said  James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Many  companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling  because they're betting that the gas market will be back in  balance in a year or two.""      The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news  for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely  survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a  barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil  prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a  return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig  count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield  roustabouts commanded premium wages.      The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> rig count, a  barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs  active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.      In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but  dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil  prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.      Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said ""In 1986, the United  States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that  replacement rate won't be any better this year.""      He added, ""We don't have the options we do with oil.  Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and  importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible  in the next 10 years because of the cost.""      Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves  were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16  trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.      George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co  agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a  new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.      ""We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to  dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990  supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later  than mid-1988,"" Gaspar said.      Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that  could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count  to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.      Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be  conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where  federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the  government unless drilling begins in the next two or three  years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon  Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have  already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later  this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.      For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will  spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest  production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of  gas per day.      But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and  Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in  recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is  on the verge of a recovery.      Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below  600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.      ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets  above 30 dlrs a barrel,"" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not  expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.      Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,  is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.      Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect  significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s  when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about  seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50  dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three  dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.  "

But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any  reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.      ""OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices  remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears  that the market should be approached cautiously,"" Montagu said.

gold,"SWEDEN'S BOLIDEN TO OPEN SAUDI ARABIAN GOLD MINE  Mining group Boliden AB said it had  agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral  Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to  exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal.      Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told Reuters the Swedish  group would  be responsible for the technical side of the  operation and would have no control over the product itself.      He said one option under discussion for refining the gold  ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in  northern Sweden.      Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it  was strategically important since it increased Boliden's  presence in Saudi Arabia.      ""Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar  already...We see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the  future,"" he said.      The new mine, which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab  in the west of the country and should open in the first half of  1988, would have an annual output of about 3,000 kilos of gold  smelted from around 120,000 tons of ore, he said.      Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi  Arabia, but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to  open in modern times.      ""This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining  technology and knowhow,"" said the group's chief executive, Kjell  Nilsson.  "
