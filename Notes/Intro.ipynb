    "We will be dealing with non-traditional data analysis techniques and data throughout the semester. Here, non-traditional is in contrast to traditional statistical approaches of inference and estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine learning\n",
    "The goal is to ***learn*** from the data in an attempt to predict. This data-driven approach is in contrast to a traditional statistical approach in which data are assumed to originate from a certain model and/or distribution. We will use **`Scikit-learn`** to implement some algorithms. \n",
    "\n",

I will be covering various data analytics techniques, but I will only cover introductory materials. If you have a prior experience with some of the analytics methods, you may find this class not very useful. From my experience in teaching other coding classes, I noticed that students with sufficient knowledge of  course materials tend to be bored and very unhappy with the class. Plus, there are only a limited number of spots available in this class, so I would like to give opportunities to those who have not been exposed to these data analytics methods before. Thus please consider whether this class is suitable for you. \n",

Otherwise, points will be deducted depending on how late it is. See the syllabus for more details.\n",
